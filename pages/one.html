        <p>THE TERRAIN&nbsp;to the east of Warsaw along the Western Bug
            is an expanse of alternating sands and swamps interspersed with evergreen and deciduous forests.
            The
            landscape is drear and villages are rare. The narrow, sandy roads where wheels sink up to the
            axle and
            walking is difficult, are something for the traveller to avoid.</p>
        <p>In the midst of this desolate country stands the small out-of-the-way station of
            Treblinka on the Siedlce railway branch line. It is some sixty kilometres from Warsaw and not
            far from
            Ma&#322;kinia station where lines from Warsaw, Bia&#322;ystok, Siedlce and &#321;om&#380;a
            meet.</p>

        <p>Many of those who were brought to Treblinka in 1942 may have had occasion to travel
            this way before the war. Staring out over the desolate landscape of pines, sand, more sand and
            again pines,
            scrubland, heather, unattractive station buildings and railway crossings, the pre-war passenger
            might have
            allowed his bored gaze to pause for a moment on a single-track spur running from the station
            into the forest
            to disappear amid the dense pines. This spur led to a pit where white sand was extracted for
            industrial
            purposes.</p>

        <p>The sand pit is situated about four kilometres from the station in an open stretch of
            country surrounded on all sides by pine woods. The soil here is poor and barren, and the
            peasants do not
            cultivate it. And so the land is bare but for a few patches of moss and an occasional sickly
            pine. Now and
            then a jackdaw or a bright-combed hoopoe wings past, but no bird stops to build its nest
            here.
        </p>

        <p>This desolate wasteland is the spot Heinrich Himmler, the SS Reichsf&uuml;hrer,
            selected and approved for the site of a slaughterhouse the like of which the human race has not
            known from
            the age of primitive barbarism to these cruel days of ours. The main SS slaughterhouse,
            surpassing those at
            Sobib&oacute;r, Majdanek, Be&#322;&#380;ec and O&#347;wi&#281;cim, was located here.
        </p>

        <p>There were two camps in Treblinka: labour camp No. 1, where prisoners of various
            nationalities, chiefly Poles, worked, and camp No. 2 for Jews.</p>

        <p>Camp No. 1, of the labour or punitive type, was located in the immediate vicinity of
            the sand pit, not far from the woods. It was one of the hundreds and thousands of similar camps
            the
            Hitlerites
