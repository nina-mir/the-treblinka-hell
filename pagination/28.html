      The SS held football matches with teams made up of condemned men, forced
      the victims to play tag, organized a chorus of the doomed. Next to the
      German dormitories was a menagerie where wolves, foxes and other
      comparatively harmless beasts of the forests were kept in cages while
      the most ferocious wild beasts the world had ever produced walked the
      earth freely, sat on benches and listened to music. They actually wrote
      a Treblinka hymn for the doomed unfortunates which included the
      following lines:
    </p>
    <div class="de poetry">
      <pre translate="no">
    F&uuml;r uns gibt&rsquo;s heute nur Treblinka,
    Das unser Schicksal ist.*
    </pre>
    </div>
    <p class="translation" translate="yes">
      * There is only Treblinka for us today&mdash;that is our fate. &nbsp;
    </p>

    <p>
      A few minutes before their death bleeding, tormented people were forced
      to sing idiotic German sentimental songs:
    </p>

    <div class="de poetry">
      <pre translate="no">
    ... Ich brach das Bl&uuml;melein
    Und schenkte es dem sch&ouml;nsten
    Geliebten M&auml;gdelein.**
    </pre>
    </div>

    <p class="translation" translate="yes">
      ** I plucked a flower and gave it to the loveliest of beloved maidens.
    </p>

      The camp&rsquo;s chief commandant selected a few children from one batch
      of prisoners, killed their parents, dressed up the children in fine
      clothes, fed them with sweets, played with them, and a few days later,
      when he was bored with them, ordered them to be killed.
    </p>

      One of the chief sources of entertainment were the night orgies of
      violence against young and beautiful women and girls who were selected
      from every group of victims. The next morning the rapers personally
      escorted their victims to the lethal chambers. This was how the SS, the
      bulwark of the Hitler regime, the pride of fascist Germany, amused
      themselves at Treblinka.

      It must be noted here that these creatures were by no means robots who
      mechanically carried out the wishes of others. All witnesses speak of a
      trait common to all of them, namely, a fondness for theoretical
      argument, a predilection for philosophizing. All of them had a weakness
      for delivering speeches to the doomed people, for boasting in front of
      their victims and explaining the &ldquo;lofty&rdquo; meaning and
      &ldquo;importance&rdquo; for the future of what was being done in
      Treblinka. They were profoundly and sincerely convinced that they were
      doing the correct and necessary thing. They explained in detail the
      superiority of their race over all other races; they delivered tirades
      about German blood, the German character and the German mission. Their
      beliefs were set down in books by Hitler and Rosenberg, in pamphlets and
      articles by Goebbels.
