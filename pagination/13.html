      Here, according to witnesses, the heartrending scenes usually began. The
      instinct of maternal, conjugal, filial love told the victims that they
      were seeing one another for the last time. Handshakes, kisses,
      blessings, tears, briefly murmured words invested with all the love, all
      the anguish, all the tenderness and despair that filled them were now
      exchanged. The SS psychiatrists of death knew that these emotions had to
      be stamped out at once. The psychiatrists of death were familiar with
      the primitive laws that operate in all the slaughterhouses of the world,
      laws which in Treblinka were applied by the cattle to the human beings.
      This was one of the most critical moments, the moment when daughters
      were separated from fathers, mothers from sons, grandmothers from
      grandsons, husbands from wives.

    <p>
      Again the words &quot;Achtung! Achtung!&quot;&nbsp;rent the air. This
      was precisely the moment when the minds of the victims had to be
      befuddled again, when a glimmer of hope had to be allowed to dawn, when
      death had to be made for a few moments to look like life.

      &quot;Women and children are to remove their footwear on entering the
      building,&quot; barks the same voice. &quot;Stockings are to be placed
      inside shoes. Children&#39;s stockings inside children&#39;s sandals,
      boots and shoes. Be orderly.&quot;
    </p>

    <p>
      And again: &quot;On entering the bathhouse take with you valuables,
      documents, money, soap and towel.... I repeat....&quot;
    </p>

    <p>
      Inside the women&#39;s bathhouse was a hairdressers&#39; department. As
      soon as they were undressed the women lined up to have their hair
      clipped off. Strange psychological effect: this final haircut, according
      to the testimony of the hairdressers themselves, had a reassuring effect
      on the women; it seemed to convince them that they really were about to
      take a bath. Young girls felt their close-cropped heads critically and
      asked the barber if she wouldn&#39;t please smooth out some of the
      uneven spots. The women usually calmed down after the haircut. Nearly
      all of them passed out of the dressing-room carrying a piece of soap and
      a folded towel. Some of the younger ones wept to part with their flowing
      tresses. Why were the women thus shorn? To deceive them? No, the hair
      was needed in Germany. It was a raw material....

      I asked many people what the Germans did with all the hair they removed
      from the heads of these living corpses. According to all the witnesses,
      the huge mountains of black, golden, chestnut hair, straight, curly and
      braided, were first disinfected and then pressed into sacks and shipped
      to Germany. All the witnesses questioned confirmed that the sacks
      containing this hair had German addresses on them. What was it used for?
      None of the camp personnel could answer this question. According to the
      written testimony of one Kohn, however, the hair was used by the navy to
      fill mattresses, to make hausers for submarines&nbsp;and for other
      similar purposes.
