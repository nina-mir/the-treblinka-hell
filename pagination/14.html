     It seems to me that this testimony requires additional confirmation;
      Grossadmiral R&auml;der, who headed the German navy in 1942, will
      furnish it.

      The men undressed in the yard. Of the first group of the morning
      arrivals some 150 to 300 would be selected for their physical strength
      to be used to bury the corpses. These would be killed the following day.
      The men were told to undress quickly, but were also warned to put down
      their clothes neatly, shoes, socks, underwear, coats and trousers
      separately. These things were sorted out by another team of workmen
      wearing red arm bands as distinct from the blue bands worn by the
      station team. Articles of clothing considered fit to be sent to Germany
      were taken away at once to the warehouse. All labels were carefully
      removed. The rest of the articles were burned or buried.

      The feeling of alarm grew, heightened by a fearful stench mingled with
      the odour of lime that assailed the nostrils. What accounted for such
      huge swarms of fat and troublesome flies? Pine woods and paved ground
      did not usually breed flies. The men began to breathe heavily; they
      started at every sound and stared hard at every trifle in search of an
      explanation, a hint that would help them to unravel the mystery and gain
      an inkling of the fate in store for them. What, for instance, were those
      gigantic excavators doing over at the southern end of the camp grounds?

      The next stage in the procedure began. The naked people were lined up at
      a window through which they were told to hand over their documents and
      valuables. And again the frightful, hypnotizing voice rapped out:
      &ldquo;Achtung! Achtung!&nbsp;The penalty for hiding valuables is death!
      Achtung!&rdquo;
    </p>

    <p class="page-end">
      A Scharf&uuml;hrer sat in a small wooden booth. SS men and guards stood
      around him. Next to the booth were wooden boxes into which the valuables
      were thrown&mdash;one for paper-money, another for coins, a third for
      wrist watches, rings, earrings and brooches with precious stones, and
      bracelets. Documents were thrown on the ground, for no one had any
      earthly use for these documents belonging to living corpses who within
      an hour would be lying stiff and dead in a pit. The gold and valuables,
      however, were carefully sorted out; dozens of jewellers were engaged in
      ascertaining the purity of the metal and the value of the stones and
      diamonds.
