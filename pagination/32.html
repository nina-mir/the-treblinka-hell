      Shots rang out and the machine guns on the towers captured by the rebels
      emitted a jubilant rat-tat-tat. The explosions of hand grenades sounded
      as triumphant as the clapping of the bell of Truth itself. The air shook
      from the detonations; buildings came crashing down, and the whistling of
      bullets deadened the odious buzzing of the carrion flies. Axes dripping
      blood flashed in the clear, pure air. On this day, August 2, the soil of
      the Treblinka hell was soaked with the evil blood of the SS men, and the
      radiant sky was tremulous with the triumph of this moment of vengeance.

      And here history repeated itself: As had happened in similar instances
      ever since the world began the creatures who had strutted as members of
      a higher race, who had thundered forth &ldquo;Achtung, M&uuml;tzen
      ab!&rdquo;, the creatures who had shouted for the people of Warsaw to
      come out of their houses to their death with the shattering compelling
      voices of master, &ldquo;Alle r-r-r-aus! Unter-r-r-r-r,&rdquo;; these
      creatures so confident of their power when it was a question of
      executing millions of women and children, showed themselves to be
      despicable cowards, miserable belly-crawling worms begging for mercy
      when it came to a real life-and-death struggle. They lost their heads,
      rushed hither and thither like frightened rats; they forgot all about
      the diabolically conceived system of defences Treblinka boasted. But is
      there really anything surprising about that, after all?
    </p>

    <p>
      Two and a half months later, October 14, 1943, there was an uprising in
      the Sobib&oacute;r death factory, organized by a Soviet war prisoner
      from Rostov, a political officer, Sashko Pechersky. And there the same
      thing was repeated as happened at Treblinka&mdash;half dead from
      starvation the people nevertheless proved able to cope with the hundreds
      of SS scoundrels bloated with the blood of their innocent victims.
      Wielding home-made axes forged in the camp smithies the rebels got the
      better of the executioners; many of them were &ldquo;armed&rdquo; with
      fine sand, with which Sashko had instructed them to fill their pockets
      beforehand for use in blinding the sentries. . . . But is there really
      anything surprising about that, after all?

    <p class="page-end">
      When Treblinka was enveloped in flames, and the rebels, bidding a silent
      farewell to the ashes of their fellow prisoners, left the barbed-wire
      compound, SS and police units were sent in pursuit. Hundreds of police
      dogs were set on their trail. The Germans brought out aircraft to hunt
      down the escaped prisoners. Battles were fought in the forests and
      marshes and few of the rebels lived to tell the tale.
