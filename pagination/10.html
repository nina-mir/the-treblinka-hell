    <p class="page-start">
      The new arrivals trembled inwardly as they sensed the strangeness of
      that cool, smug leer on the faces of the Hitlerites watching them, the
      look of a live beast that feels its superiority over a dead man. In
      those brief moments on the square the newcomers found themselves
      noticing more and more incomprehensible and alarming details.
    </p>

    <p>
      What was behind that massive six-metre wall completely covered with
      yellowing pine branches and blankets? The blankets too inspired fear:
      they were quilted or gaily coloured, silk, or in calico covers, exactly
      like those lying in the bedrolls of the newly arrived travellers. How
      had they come here? Who had brought them? And where were their owners?
      Why had they no further use for their blankets? And who were these men
      with the blue bands on their arms? They began to recall all the stories
      they had heard recently, all the terrifying rumours that had been
      whispered back and forth. No, no, it could not be! And they dismissed
      the fearful thought.
    </p>

    <p>
      This feeling of alarm lasted for a few moments, until all the passengers
      had emerged on the square. There was always a slight delay at this point
      for in every party there were crippled, lame, aged and sick people who
      had to be helped along.
    </p>

    <p>
      But now the train was empty and the square full. In a loud voice an
      Unterscharf&uuml;hrer (junior non-commissioned SS officer) instructed
      the passengers to leave all their things on the square and prepare to go
      to the bathhouse, taking along only personal papers, valuables and
      toilet accessories. No doubt a dozen questions occurred to the
      people&mdash;should they take clean underwear, might they undo their
      bundles, would their belongings not get mixed up or lost if they did?
      But some mysterious, irresistible force impelled them to hurry forward
      in silence without asking questions or turning round, impelled them
      toward the opening in the six-metre barbed-wire fence camouflaged with
      boughs.
    </p>

    <p class="page-end">
      Inside they walked past tank obstacles, past the barbed-wire fence three
      times the height of a man, past an anti-tank ditch three metres wide,
      past thin coils of steel wire strewn on the ground to trip up the
      fugitive and catch him like a fly in a spiderweb, and again past a high
      barbed-wire fence. A terrible sensation of despair, a feeling of utter
      helplessness would seize the newcomer. There could be no question of
      escaping, of going back, or of fighting; from the low squat wooden
      towers the muzzles of heavy machine guns stared menacingly at them. Cry
      for help? What was the use with all these SS men and guards armed with
      tommy guns, hand grenades and pistols? Power was in their hands. Theirs
      the tanks and aircraft, the land, the towns, theirs the sky, the
      railways, the laws, the newspapers and the radio. The whole world was
      silent, crushed and enslaved by the brown-shirted gang which had seized
      power. And only in one spot, thousands of kilometres off, Soviet
      artillery was pounding away on the distant Volga bank, stubbornly
      putting into effect the great will of the Russian people to fight to the
      death for liberty, disturbing the quiet, challenging the people of the
      world to fight.
