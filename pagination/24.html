    No, it is impossible to imagine what took place in that chamber....</p>

    <p>
      The dead bodies stood pressed close together, growing colder and colder.
      The children, witnesses maintain, clung to life longer than the adults.
      Within twenty to twenty-five minutes Schmitt&rsquo;s assistants would
      peer through the peepholes. The time had come to open the doors to the
      platforms. Urged on by the SS men, prisoners in overalls set about
      emptying the chambers. Since the floor sloped toward the platforms, many
      of the corpses rolled out by themselves. People who worked here told me
      that the faces of the corpses were yellow and that about seventy percent
      bled slightly at the nose and the mouth. Physiologists can no doubt
      explain this.
    </p>

    <p>
      SS men inspected the bodies exchanging remarks as they did so. If a
      groan or a slight movement showed that life still lingered, revolver
      shots snuffed it out at once. Then came teams of men armed with dental
      pincers to extract all gold or platinum teeth from the mouths of the
      corpses. These teeth were sorted out according to value, packed in boxes
      and sent to Germany. There is no doubt that had it been convenient or
      advantageous for the SS to extract the teeth from living people, they
      would have done so with no compunction, but evidently it was simpler to
      extract the teeth from corpses.
    </p>

    <p>
      The bodies were loaded in waggonettes and hauled to huge common graves,
      where they were laid in rows packed close together. The pit would not be
      filled in yet.
    </p>

    <p>
      While the gas chambers were being emptied out, the Scharf&uuml;hrer
      working on &ldquo;transport&rdquo; received a brief order over the
      phone. Thereupon he blew his whistle and the locomotive engineer shunted
      the next twenty cars up to the platform with the dummy station of
      Ober-Majdan. Another three or four thousand people carrying suitcases,
      bundles and packages of food alighted and walked to the station square.
      Mothers carried infants in their arms; the older children pressed close
      to their mothers&rsquo; skirts, staring curiously about them. There was
      something frightening about the square tramped down by so many millions
      of human feet. Why did the railway line end just beyond the station in a
      stretch of sere grass and a six-metre barbed-wire fence?...
    </p>

    <p>
      The whole gruesome business was timed perfectly so that the new victims
      started up the &quot;road from which there is no return&quot; at the
      very moment when the last corpses were being hauled to the ditches from
      the gas chambers. And the ditches stood open, waiting....
    </p>

    <p>
      And the camp commandant seated in his office amid heaps of papers and
      charts would telephone to Treblinka station. Another sixty-car train
      under a strong SS escort armed with light machine-guns and automatic
      rifles pulled heavily out of a siding and crawled to the narrow-gauge
      track running between the two rows of pine trees.
    </p>

    <p class="page-end">
      The huge excavators operated day and night, digging huge dark ditches
      hundreds of metres long and many metres deep. And the ditches stood
      open. They were waiting. They did not wait long.
