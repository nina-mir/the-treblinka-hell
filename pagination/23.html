      Diverse poisons, too, were employed, but this was experimentation; the
      first two were the methods generally used for mass murder on industrial
      scale.

      Thus, the work of the Treblinka conveyor was so designed, as to enable
      the beasts to deprive man successively of all the rights and privileges
      he had enjoyed throughout the ages.

      First they robbed him of freedom, home and country, and took him to a
      nameless bit of wasteland set in the midst of forests. Then they took
      his personal effects, his letters, photographs of his near ones, and
      after that, on the other side of the fence, they took away his mother,
      his wife, his child. They stripped him naked, took away his documents
      and flung them carelessly aside; in doing so they deprived him of his
      name. They drove him into a narrow passage with a low brick ceiling and
      thus robbed him at once of the sky, the stars, the wind and the sun.

      Then came the last act in the human tragedy, when the man passed through
      the last gate of the Treblinka hell. The doors of the concrete chamber
      clanged to behind him. These doors were held fast by a combined lock
      consisting of a massive bolt, a chain and a hook. There was no breaking
      down of this door.

      Can we overcome our horror and try to imagine how the people in these
      chambers felt during the last minutes of their lives?... Packed together
      so tightly that bones cracked and crushed chests could not expand to
      breathe, they stood there, one mass of humanity, covered with the clammy
      sweat of imminent death. Someone, with the wisdom of age perhaps, may
      have conquered his own fear sufficiently to say to the others:
      &quot;Take heart, this is the end.&quot; Someone no doubt shouted a
      terrible curse.... Those curses must come true! We can picture some
      mother making a superhuman effort to obtain a whit more breathing space
      for her child in order that his last anguished gasps might be alleviated
      if only by one-millionth by this last evidence of maternal solicitude.
      We can hear some young girl, her tongue turning to lead, ask piteously:
      &quot;But why are they suffocating me, why?&quot;

      What visions passed before the glassy eyes of the victims as their heads
      spun and their breath was stifled in their bodies? Their childhood, the
      happy days of peace, the last painful journey. Someone may have
      remembered the leering face of the SS man on the station square and
      thought: &quot;So that is why he laughed!&quot; The brain swam,
      consciousness faded and the last moment of terrible agony came....
