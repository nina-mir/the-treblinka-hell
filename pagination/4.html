      We know Sviderski, the one-eyed German from Odessa, known as the
      &quot;hammer expert&quot; because of his consummate skill at killing
      without firearms. Within the space of a few minutes, he hammered to
      death fifteen children between the ages of eight and thirteen declared
      unfit for work. We know the skinny SS man known as &quot;old
      Preiff,&quot; a gloomy and morose individual who looked like a Gypsy.
      &quot;Old Preiff&quot; relieved the monotony of his existence by sitting
      near the garbage dump and shooting camp inmates who would steal over to
      pick up potato peels. He would force his victim to open his jaws and
      then shoot him in the mouth.

      We know the names of the professional murderers Schwarz and Ledeke who
      amused themselves by shooting at prisoners returning from work. They
      killed twenty to forty people every day.

      There was nothing human about these creatures. Warped minds, hearts and
      souls, their words, behaviour and habits were like a horrible caricature
      of the behaviour, habits, thoughts and feelings of normal Germans. The
      order that existed in the camp; the documentation of the murders; the
      predilection for monstrous practical jokes faintly reminiscent of the
      jokes of drunken German student brawls; the chorus singing of
      sentimental songs amid pools of blood; the speeches they were
      continually delivering to their doomed victims; the sermons and pious,
      neatly printed texts hung all over the place&mdash;all these were the
      monster dragons and reptiles that had sprung from the embryo of
      traditional German chauvinism, the arrogance, conceit, vanity,
      self-assurance, slobbery nest-feathering and utter indifference to the
      fate of all living beings, arising from a fierce, blind conviction that
      German science, music, poetry, language, flower beds, water closets,
      sky, beer and homes were the finest and best in the whole universe. The
      horrible vices and fearful crimes of these people were offshoots of the
      vices of the German national character.

      Such was the routine in this camp, this lesser Majdanek. One might think
      that there could be nothing more terrible in all the world. Yet those
      who lived in Camp No. 1 knew very well that there was something a
      hundred times more ghastly than their camp.
