      To snuff out life ten to twenty-five minutes were required. In the early
      period after the starting of the new chambers, when the executioners had
      not yet established the efficiency peak and were still experimenting,
      the victims were subjected to fearful torture lasting for two and three
      hours before life left their tormented bodies. During the very first
      days the intake and outlet installations worked badly and the victims
      writhed in agony for anything up to eight or ten hours.
    </p>

    <p>
      Various means were employed to effect this mass slaughter. One of them
      was by forcing into the chambers the exhaust fumes from the engine of a
      heavy tank that served as a motor at the Treblinka power station. These
      fumes contained two to three percent of carbon monoxide, which has the
      property when inhaled of combining with the hemoglobin of the blood to
      form a stable compound known as carboxyhemoglobin. Carboxyhemoglobin is
      far more stable than the compound of oxygen and hemoglobin formed in the
      course of the respiratory process. In some fifteen minutes the
      hemoglobin combines with carbon monoxide to form a stable compound and
      is no longer capable of serving as an oxygen carrier. The victim begins
      gasping for air, but no oxygen reaches the suffocating organism; the
      heart beats as if ready to burst, driving blood into the lungs, but the
      poisoned blood can no longer assimilate the oxygen in the air. Breathing
      becomes hoarse, all the symptoms of painful strangulation appear,
      consciousness dims, and the victim perishes just as if he had been
      strangled.
    </p>

      The second method, and one that was the most widely used, was pumping
      air out of the chambers with suction pumps until the victims were dead.
      As in the case of the first method, death was caused by depriving the
      victims of oxygen.
    </p>

    <p class="page-end">
      The third method, used less but nevertheless used, was murder with
      steam. This method, too, aimed at depriving the organism of oxygen, for
      the steam was used to expel the air from the chambers.
