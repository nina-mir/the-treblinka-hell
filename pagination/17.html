      Zepf&rsquo;s acts were part of the hideous farce staged by the
      tormentors to stun the mentality of their doomed victims; they were an
      expression of the senseless cruelty employed for the purpose of
      undermining will and consciousness. It was an essential screw in the
      huge machine of the fascist state.

      The horror of it is not that nature should beget such
      degenerates&mdash;for there is much that is freakish in the organic
      world&mdash;such as cyclopes, two-headed creatures, and creatures with
      corresponding mental deformities and abnormalities. What is dreadful is
      that these creatures, who ought to have been isolated and placed under
      observation as psychiatric phenomena, should be allowed to exist and
      function as citizens in some one state. Their insane mentality, their
      diseased minds, their phenomenal crimes are the necessary elements of
      the fascist state. Thousands, tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands
      of creatures like these form the backbone of German fascism, the
      mainstay and foundation of Hitler Germany. Dressed in uniforms, carrying
      weapons, and decorated with orders of the empire, these creatures lorded
      it for years over the lives of the European peoples. It is not the
      creatures themselves that should fill us with horror, but the state that
      caused them to crawl out of their holes, and made them useful,
      indispensable and irreplaceable in places like Treblinka, near Warsaw,
      at the Lublin Majdanek, in Be&#322;&#380;ec, in Sobib&oacute;r, in
      O&#347;wi&#281;cim, in Baby Yar, in Domanewka and Bogdanovka near
      Odessa, in Trostyanets near Minsk, at Ponary in Lithuania, in tens and
      hundreds of prisons, labour and punitive camps, camps for the extinction
      of life.

      The journey from the booth to the place of execution took only a few
      minutes. Hurried forward by blows, deafened by shouts, the victims
      reached the third open lot, and for a moment halted in astonishment.

      Before them stood a handsome stone building decorated with wooden
      fretwork and built in the style of an ancient temple. Five broad
      concrete steps led up to a low, massive and handsomely decorated door.
      Flowers grew at the entrance. For the rest, however, chaos reigned.
      There were mountains of fresh earth everywhere. A huge excavator clanked
      and rattled as it dug up tons of yellow sandy soil with its steel jaws,
      raising a cloud of dust that blotted out the sun. The roar of the
      machine digging huge graves from morning till night mingled with the
      savage barking of dozens of Alsatian dogs.
