      The fenced-in area of the camp with its warehouses for the belongings of
      the executed, platforms and other auxiliary premises occupied an
      insignificant area, 780 metres in length and 600 metres in width. If one
      were to entertain the slightest doubt as to the fate of the millions who
      were brought here, or to assume for a moment that they were not murdered
      immediately upon arrival, the question then arises: what became of all
      these people of whom there were enough to populate a small state or a
      large European capital? Where are they? For thirteen months or 396 days,
      the trains returned empty or loaded with sand; not a single one of those
      who were brought to Camp No. 2 ever returned. The time has come to ask
      the stern question: &ldquo;Cain, where are they whom thou broughtest
      hither?&rdquo;

      Fascism did not succeed in concealing its terrible crime. But not
      because thousands of people were its unwilling witnesses. Confident that
      he could act with impunity, Hitler took the decision to exterminate
      millions of innocent people during the summer of 1942 when the Wehrmacht
      was at the zenith of its sanguinary career. It can now be proved that
      the statistics of the murders perpetrated by the Germans reach their
      highest mark in 1942. Confident that they could act with impunity, the
      fascists showed what they are capable of.

      Had Adolf Hitler been victorious, he would have succeeded in covering up
      all the traces of his crimes; he would have forced all the witnesses to
      be silent, even if there had been scores of thousands instead of a few
      thousand. Not one of them would have uttered a word. And once again you
      cannot help wanting to pay homage to the men who in the autumn of 1942,
      when the whole world that is now humming so noisily and victoriously was
      silent, battled in Stalingrad on the banks of the Volga against the
      German army, a river of innocent blood smoking and gurgling behind their
      backs. It was the Red Army that prevented Himmler from keeping the
      secret of Treblinka.
