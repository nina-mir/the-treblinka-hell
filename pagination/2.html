      The thrift, precision, calculation and pedantic cleanliness common to
      many Germans are not bad traits in themselves. Applied to agriculture or
      to industry they produce laudable results. Hitlerism applied these
      traits to crime against mankind and the Reich&rsquo;s SS behaved in the
      Polish labour camp exactly as though they were raising cauliflower or
      potatoes.
    </p>

    <p>
      The area of the camp was laid out in neat rectangles; the barracks stood
      in the straightest of rows; the paths were lined with birches and
      covered with gravel. There were concrete ponds for domestic fowl, pools
      for washing laundry with steps leading conveniently down, various
      services for the German personnel&mdash;a modern bakery, barbershop,
      garage, a gasolene-pump topped by a glass ball, warehouses. Built on
      approximately the same principle&mdash;with the gardens, the drinking
      fountains, the concrete paths&mdash;was the camp at Majdanek and dozens
      of other labour camps in East Poland where the Gestapo and the SS
      intended settling down. German precision and petty calculation, the
      pedantic fondness for orderliness, the German love for time tables and
      charts with the minutest details worked out were reflected in the layout
      of these camps.
    </p>

    <p class="page-end">
      People were brought to the labour camp for brief periods, sometimes no
      more than four, five or six months. They were Poles who had violated
      laws laid down by the governor-generalship&mdash;minor violations, as a
      rule, since the penalty for major violations was immediate death. A slip
      of the tongue, a chance word overheard on the street, failure to make
      some delivery, refusal to give a cart or a horse to a German, the harsh
      word of a girl declining the amorous advances of some SS man, not
      sabotage at factories but mere suspicion of the possibility of
      sabotage&mdash;these were the offences that brought hundreds and
      thousands of Polish workers, peasants and intellectuals, men and girls,
      mothers of families, old people and juveniles, to this labour camp.
      Altogether about 50,000 people passed through its gates. Jews were sent
      there only if they happened to be skilled workers in their
      field&mdash;bakers, shoemakers, cabinet-makers, stone-masons or tailors.
      The camp had all manner of workshops, including a substantial furniture
      factory which supplied armchairs, tables and chairs to German Army
      Headquarters.
