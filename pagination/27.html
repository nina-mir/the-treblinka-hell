      The SS men subjected the group of rebels from the Warsaw ghetto to
      especially vicious torture. They picked out the women and children and
      took them not to the gas chambers but to the cremation ovens. They
      forced the mothers, half crazed with terror, to lead their children
      between the red-hot bars on which thousands of dead bodies writhed and
      squirmed from the heat, twisting and turning as though alive; where the
      bellies of dead women with child burst open from the heat and still-born
      infants burned up inside rent wombs. This spectacle was enough to rob
      the strongest man of his reason, but the Germans knew that its effect
      would be a thousand times more terrible on a mother who was frantically
      trying to shield the eyes of her children from the ghastly sight while
      they shrieked in terror: &quot;Mama, mama, what are they going to do to
      us? Will they burn us?&quot; There were no such scenes in Dante&rsquo;s
      inferno.
    </p>

      After they had amused themselves sufficiently with this spectacle, the
      Germans actually did throw the children into the flames.

      It is painful even to read about all this. The reader must believe me
      when I say that it is even more painful to write about it. &quot;Why
      write then?&quot; someone might say. &quot;What is the use of recalling
      all this?&quot;

      It is the duty of a writer to tell the truth however gruelling, and the
      duty of the reader to learn the truth. To turn aside, or to close
      one&rsquo;s eyes to the truth is to insult the memory of the dead. The
      person who does not learn the whole truth will never understand what
      kind of enemy, what sort of monster, our great Red Army is waging battle
      against to the death.

      The &quot;infirmary&quot; was also rearranged. At first all the sick
      were carried out to a fenced-off clearing where they were met by a
      so-called doctor and murdered. The bodies of the aged and sick who had
      been murdered were then conveyed on stretchers to the common graves. Now
      a round pit was dug and a grating laid at the bottom for the burning of
      corpses. Around the pit low benches like seats in a sports stadium were
      placed so close to the edge that anyone sitting on them was literally
      suspended over the edge of the pit. The sick and feeble who were taken
      into the &quot;infirmary&quot; were led to these benches facing the
      bonfire built of human bodies. After enjoying the situation to the full,
      the Nazi barbarians then proceeded to shoot at the grey heads and bent
      backs of the old people, who fell, dead or wounded, into the blazing
      fire.

      We never had a very high opinion of the German brand of humour. It was
      always far too heavy for our taste. But who could ever have conceived of
      anything like the sense of humour, the amusements, the practical jokes
      of the SS men at Treblinka?
