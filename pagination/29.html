    <p class="page-start">
      After a day of &ldquo;work&rdquo; and amusements such as those described
      above, they slept the sleep of the just, undisturbed by dreams or
    </p>

    <p>
      nightmares. Their conscience never worried them for the simple reason
      that they had no conscience. They went in for physical exercises, took
      great care of their health, drank milk every morning, were extremely
      fussy about their personal comforts, planted flowers in front of their
      homes and built summer-houses. Several times a year they went home to
      Germany on leave since their particular &ldquo;profession&rdquo; was
      considered &ldquo;injurious&rdquo; and their superiors jealously guarded
      their health. At home they walked about proudly, and if they did not
      talk about their work it was not because they were ashamed of it, but
      simply because, being disciplined, they did not dare to violate the
      solemn pledge to silence they had taken. And when they went arm-in-arm
      with their wives to the cinema of an evening and laughed loudly,
      stamping with their hobnailed boots on the floor in delight, it was hard
      to tell them apart from the average German man in the street. Yet these
      were beasts in the most literal meaning of the word.
    </p>

    <p>
      The summer of 1943 was exceptionally hot in these regions. There was not
      a drop of rain, not a cloud, not a puff of wind for many weeks. The
      burning of bodies proceeded at top speed. For nearly six months the
      furnaces had been going day and night, but little more than half of the
      dead had been cremated.
    </p>

    <p>
      The fearful moral and physical suffering began to tell on the prisoners
      whose job it was to burn the corpses. Between fifteen and twenty of them
      committed suicide every day. Many deliberately courted death by
      violating disciplinary rules. &ldquo;To get a bullet was a
      luxury,&rdquo; a baker from Kosow who had escaped from the camp told me.
      It was said that to be doomed to live in Treblinka was a hundred times
      worse than to be doomed to death.
    </p>

    <p class="page-end">
      Charred bones and ashes were carried outside the camp grounds. Peasants
      from the village of Wulka were mobilized by the Germans to load the
      ashes on carts and strew it along the road leading from the death camp
      to the Polish labour camp. Child prisoners threw shovelfuls of ashes
      onto the road from the carts. Sometimes they would find melted gold
      coins or gold dental crowns among the ashes. These juvenile prisoners
      were called the &ldquo;children from the black road,&rdquo; because the
      ashes made the road black as a mourning ribbon. Car wheels made a
      peculiar swishing sound as they rolled over this road. When I travelled
      this way I kept hearing that mournful swoosh, coming from beneath the
      wheels like a low, timid plaint.
    </p>

    <p>
      The peasants carted the charred bones and ashes from the spring of 1943
      until the summer of 1944. Every day twenty carts went out, each one
      making six or eight trips in the course of the day. In every load went
      100-125 kilograms of ashes and charred bones.
    </p>

    <p>
      In the &ldquo;Treblinka&rdquo; song the Germans forced the eight hundred
      corpse-burners to sing were words exhorting the prisoners to humbleness
      and obedience in reward for which they were promised &ldquo;a tiny bit
      of happiness which passes in a flash.&rdquo; Surprisingly enough there
      actually was one happy day in the Treblinka inferno. The Germans,
      however, were mistaken: neither obedience nor humility gave that day to
      the Treblinka doomed. It was the reckless courage of the brave that
      brought it into being.
    </p>

    <p>
      They had nothing to lose. They were all doomed, every day of their lives
      was hell. Not one of the witnesses of the frightful crimes would have
      been spared. The gas chamber awaited them one and all; in fact most of
      them were killed after working for a few days and replaced by new
      workers from the current groups of victims. Only a few dozen men lived
      weeks and months instead of days and hours. These were skilled workers,
      carpenters, stone-masons, or the bakers, tailors and barbers who served
      the Germans. It was they who formed a committee of revolt. Only
      condemned men, only men possessed by an all-consuming hatred and a
      fierce thirst for revenge could have conceived such a mad plan of
      revolt. They did not want to escape before destroying Treblinka. And
      they destroyed it.
    </p>

    <p>
      Weapons&mdash;axes, knives, truncheons&mdash;began to appear in the
      workers&rsquo; barracks. At what a price, at what a tremendous risk was
      each axe and knife procured! What incredible patience, cunning and skill
      was required to hide all this from the Argus eyes of the guards! The
      workers laid in stocks of gasolene to use for setting fire to the camp
      buildings. How did this gasolene accumulate and how did it disappear
      without trace as if it had evaporated into thin air? By superhuman
      effort, great mental strain, will power and fierce daring. A tunnel was
      then dug underneath the German arsenal building. Here again sheer daring
      worked miracles; the god of courage was on their side. Twenty hand
      grenades, a machine gun, rifles and pistols were carried out of the
      arsenal and secreted in hiding places known to the conspirators alone.
      The latter divided themselves into groups of five. The extraordinarily
      complex plan for the uprising was worked out to the minutest detail.
      Every group had its definite assignment. And, each of these
      mathematically perfect assignments was a piece of sheer madness in
      itself.
    </p>

    <p>
      One group was given the task of storming the watch towers, where the
      guards sat behind machine guns. Other groups were to attack the sentries
      on duty at the entrances to the camp grounds. Others were to tackle the
      armoured cars, to cut telephone communications, to attack the barracks,
      to cut passages through the barbed wire, to lay bridges across the
      anti-tank ditches, to pour gasolene on the camp buildings, to set fire
      to them and to destroy everything that lent itself easily to
      destruction.
    </p>

    <p>
      The plan even provided for the supply of money to the escaped prisoners.
      A Warsaw doctor who collected the money nearly gave the whole show away.
      One day a Scharf&uuml;hrer noticed a fat bundle of banknotes sticking
      out of his pocket&mdash;it was the current sum the doctor had intended
      to hide. The Scharf&uuml;hrer pretended not to have noticed it and
      reported the matter to Franz. Franz decided to question the doctor
      himself. He suspected something immediately. Why should a doomed man
      need money? Franz proceeded to cross-examine his victim with calm
      deliberation; he was convinced no person on earth could equal him in
      torturing a victim. But the Warsaw doctor outwitted the SS Hauptmann. He
      took poison. One of the participants in the uprising told me that never
      in Treblinka had such efforts been made to save a man&rsquo;s life.
      Evidently Franz realized that the dying doctor would carry his secret
      with him. But the German poison worked well and the secret remained
      unrevealed.
    </p>

    <p>
      Toward the end of July the heat became unbearable. Steam issued from the
      graves when they were opened as from gigantic boilers. The terrific
      stench and the heat of the furnaces killed men who toiled on the burning
      of the corpses. They dropped dead, falling headlong into the blazing
      furnace. Thousands of millions of fat-bellied flies crawled along the
      ground or filled the air with their monotonous drone. The last hundred
      thousand corpses were being burned.
    </p>

    <p>
      The uprising was scheduled for August 2. A revolver shot was its signal.
      Fortune favoured the sacred cause of the rebels. A new flame leapt
      skywards, not the thick heavy black smoke and flame of burning bodies,
      but the bright, hot and dancing flame of a conflagration. The camp
      buildings flared up and to the rebels it seemed that the sun had rent
      itself asunder and was burning over Treblinka, a symbol of the triumph
      of freedom and honour.
    </p>

    <p>
      Shots rang out and the machine guns on the towers captured by the rebels
      emitted a jubilant rat-tat-tat. The explosions of hand grenades sounded
      as triumphant as the clapping of the bell of Truth itself. The air shook
      from the detonations; buildings came crashing down, and the whistling of
      bullets deadened the odious buzzing of the carrion flies. Axes dripping
      blood flashed in the clear, pure air. On this day, August 2, the soil of
      the Treblinka hell was soaked with the evil blood of the SS men, and the
      radiant sky was tremulous with the triumph of this moment of vengeance.
    </p>

    <p>
      And here history repeated itself: As had happened in similar instances
      ever since the world began the creatures who had strutted as members of
      a higher race, who had thundered forth &ldquo;Achtung, M&uuml;tzen
      ab!&rdquo;, the creatures who had shouted for the people of Warsaw to
      come out of their houses to their death with the shattering compelling
      voices of master, &ldquo;Alle r-r-r-aus! Unter-r-r-r-r,&rdquo;; these
      creatures so confident of their power when it was a question of
      executing millions of women and children, showed themselves to be
      despicable cowards, miserable belly-crawling worms begging for mercy
      when it came to a real life-and-death struggle. They lost their heads,
      rushed hither and thither like frightened rats; they forgot all about
      the diabolically conceived system of defences Treblinka boasted. But is
      there really anything surprising about that, after all?
    </p>

    <p>
      Two and a half months later, October 14, 1943, there was an uprising in
      the Sobib&oacute;r death factory, organized by a Soviet war prisoner
      from Rostov, a political officer, Sashko Pechersky. And there the same
      thing was repeated as happened at Treblinka&mdash;half dead from
      starvation the people nevertheless proved able to cope with the hundreds
      of SS scoundrels bloated with the blood of their innocent victims.
      Wielding home-made axes forged in the camp smithies the rebels got the
      better of the executioners; many of them were &ldquo;armed&rdquo; with
      fine sand, with which Sashko had instructed them to fill their pockets
      beforehand for use in blinding the sentries. . . . But is there really
      anything surprising about that, after all?
    </p>

    <p>
      When Treblinka was enveloped in flames, and the rebels, bidding a silent
      farewell to the ashes of their fellow prisoners, left the barbed-wire
      compound, SS and police units were sent in pursuit. Hundreds of police
      dogs were set on their trail. The Germans brought out aircraft to hunt
      down the escaped prisoners. Battles were fought in the forests and
      marshes and few of the rebels lived to tell the tale.
    </p>

    <p>
      Treblinka ceased to exist on August 2. The Germans completed the burning
      of the remaining corpses, dismantled the brick buildings, removed the
      barbed wire, set fire to the wooden barracks that had survived the
      mutiny. The equipment of the death factory was blown up or dismantled
      and shipped away; the furnaces were destroyed, the excavators taken away
      and the huge innumerable ditches filled in with earth. The station
      building was razed to the last brick; the railway track and even the
      ties were removed. Lupine was planted on the site of the camp and a
      settler named Straben built himself a house there. The house is no
      longer there, for it has been burnt down since.
    </p>

    <p>
      What was the object of all this destruction? Was it to hide the traces
      of the murder of millions of people in the hell of Treblinka? But how
      did they expect to do this? Did they really think it possible to force
      the thousands who had witnessed the death trains moving from all corners
      of Europe to the death conveyor to keep silent? Did they believe they
      could hide that deadly flame and the smoke which hung for eight months
      in the sky, visible by day and by night to the inhabitants of dozens of
      villages and small towns? Did they think they could make the peasants of
      the Wulka village forget the fearful shrieks of the women and children
      which lasted for thirteen long months and which seem to ring in their
      ears to this very day? Did they imagine they could compel the peasants
      who had strewn the roads with human ashes for a whole year to keep
      silent? Did they imagine that they could compel to silence the survivors
      who had seen the Treblinka slaughterhouse in operation from its
      inception until August 2, 1943, the last day of its existence; the
      witnesses who have given accurate and corroborated accounts of every SS
      man and guard; witnesses who, step by step, have helped to reproduce a
      faithful picture of life in Treblinka from day to day? These can no
      longer be ordered: &ldquo;M&uuml;tzen ab!&rdquo;, these can no longer be
      led off to the lethal chamber. And Himmler no longer has power over
      these henchmen of his who with bowed heads and fingers that tug
      nervously at the edges of their jackets recount in dull toneless voices
      the delirium-like story of their crimes.
    </p>

    <p>
      A Soviet officer wearing the green ribbon of the Stalingrad Medal takes
      down page after page of the assassins&rsquo; depositions. At the door
      stands a sentry, his lips pressed tight. The same Stalingrad Medal hangs
      on his chest. His gaunt, weather-beaten face is grim. It is the face of
      popular justice. How symbolical&nbsp;it is, actually, that one of the
      victorious Stalingrad armies has come here to Treblinka, near Warsaw! It
      was not for nothing that Heinrich Himmler rushed to Treblinka by plane
      in February 1943, not for nothing that he ordered furnaces to be built
      and the traces to be burned and wiped out. No, it was to no purpose that
      he hurried so! The Stalingrad fighters came to Treblinka; the road from
      the Volga to the Vistula proved short. Now the very soil of Treblinka
      refuses to be an accomplice in the crime, in the atrocities that have
      been committed, and it spews forth the bones and the belongings of the
      murdered victims, whom the Hitlerites so vainly tried to hide in its
      depths.
    </p>

    <p>
      We arrived at the Treblinka camp early in September, thirteen months
      after the day of the uprising. For thirteen months the slaughterhouse
      had been in operation. For thirteen months the Germans had endeavoured
      to hide the traces of its work.
    </p>

    <p>
      It was quiet. The tops of the pines flanking the railway track barely
      stirred. Millions of human eyes had stared out of the carriage windows
      at these pines, this sand, this old tree stump, as the train pulled
      slowly into the platform. The ashes and crushed slag on the black road
      lined in neat German fashion with whitewashed stones swished softly.
    </p>

    <p>
      We enter the camp. We are treading the soil of Treblinka. The lupine
      pods burst open at the slightest touch, burst open by themselves with a
      faint popping sound; millions of tiny peas roll on the ground. The
      rattle of the falling peas, the popping sound of the bursting pods merge
      into a soft, mournful melody like a funeral dirge&mdash;faint,
      sorrowful, gentle&mdash;issuing from the bowels of the earth. The soil,
      rich and juicy as though linseed oil had been poured on it, the
      fathomless earth of Treblinka, as oozy as the sea bottom, gives under
      your feet. This plot of land fenced off with barbed wire has consumed
      more human lives than all the oceans and seas in the world ever since
      the birth of mankind.
    </p>

    <p>
      The earth ejects crushed bones, teeth, bits of paper and clothing; it
      refuses to keep its awful secret. These things emerge from the unhealed
      wounds in the earth. There they are&mdash;the half-rotted shirts of the
      slain, the trousers, shoes, tarnished cigarette-cases, the tiny
      cogwheels of watches, penknives, shaving brushes, candlesticks,
      children&rsquo;s shoes with red pompons, towels with Ukrainian
      embroidery, lace underwear, scissors, thimbles, corsets, trusses. Out of
      another fissure in the earth crawl heaps of utensils: cups, pots,
      basins, tins, pans, aluminium mugs, bowls, children&rsquo;s bakelite
      cups.... And beyond, out of the bottomless, swollen earth, as though
      pushed forward into the light of day by some invisible hand, emerge
      half-rotted Soviet passports, notebooks with Bulgarian writing,
      photographs of children from Warsaw and Vienna, letters written in
      childish scrawl, a volume of poetry, a prayer copied on a yellowed
      fragment of paper, food ration coupons from Germany.... Hundreds of
      perfume bottles of all shapes and sizes, green, pink, blue.... Pervading
      everything is the nauseating stench of corruption, a stench that neither
      fire nor sunshine, rain, snow or wind have been able to overcome. And
      hundreds of tiny forest flies swarm over the decaying fragments of
      clothing and paper.
    </p>

    <p>
      We walk over the bottomless Treblinka earth and suddenly something
      causes us to halt in our tracks. It is the sight of a lock of hair
      gleaming like burnished copper, the soft lovely hair of a young girl
      trampled into the ground, and next to it a lock of light blonde hair,
      and farther on a thick dark braid gleaming against the light sand; and
      beyond that more and more. These are evidently the contents of one, but
      only one, of the sacks of hair the Germans had neglected to ship off.
    </p>

    <p>
      Then it is all true! The last wild hope that it might be a ghastly
      nightmare has gone. The lupine pods pop open, the tiny peas beat a faint
      tattoo as though a myriad of tiny bells were really ringing a funeral
      dirge deep down under the ground. And it seems the heart must surely
      burst under the weight of sorrow, grief and pain that is beyond human
      endurance.
    </p>

    <p>
      Scientists, sociologists, criminologists, psychiatrists and philosophers
      are puzzling over this phenomenon. What is it&mdash;innate or
      hereditary, is it the result of upbringing, environment, external
      influences, is it predetermined by history or is it the criminal will of
      the leaders? What is it, how did it come to pass? The embryonic traits
      of the race theory which sounded so comical when expounded by
      second-rate pseudo-professors or the puny provincial theoreticians of
      last-century Germany, the contempt of the German philistine for the
      Russian, the Pole, the Jew, the French, the British, the Greek and the
      Czech, the whole of this cheap and tawdry German superiority over the
      rest of mankind that was good-naturedly laughed off by journalists and
      humorists, was suddenly in the course of a few years transformed from
      mere childish babble into a deadly menace to mankind, a menace to life
      and freedom and became the source of incredible and unparalleled
      suffering, bloodshed and crime. There is definite food for thought here.
    </p>

    <p>
      Wars like the present are terrible indeed. Rivers of innocent blood have
      been spilt by the Germans. But today it is not enough to speak of the
      responsibility of Germany for what has happened. Today we must speak of
      the responsibility of all nations and of every citizen in the world for
      the future.
    </p>

    <p>
      Every man and woman today is in duty bound to his conscience, to his son
      and his mother, to his country and to mankind to examine his heart and
      conscience and reply to the question: what is it that gave rise to
      racism, what can be done in order that Nazism, Hitlerism may never rise
      again, either on this or the other side of the ocean, never unto
      eternity.
    </p>

    <p>
      The imperialist idea of national, race, or any other exceptionalism led
      the Hitlerites logically to Majdanek, Sobib&oacute;r, Be&#322;zec,
      O&#347;wi&#281;cim and Treblinka.
    </p>

    <p>
      We must remember that racism, fascism will emerge from this war not only
      with bitter recollections of defeat but also with sweet memories of the
      ease with which it is possible to slaughter millions of defenceless
      people.
    </p>

    <p>
      This must be solemnly borne in mind by all who value honour, liberty and
      the life of all nations, of all mankind.
