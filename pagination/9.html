      Thus three to four thousand people carrying suitcases, bags and bundles
      and supporting the aged and the weak, would find themselves on this
      square. Among them were mothers who carried infants in their arms, while
      older children huddled against their skirts, staring curiously at the
      strange surroundings. There was something frightening about this square
      which had been tramped down by so many millions of human feet. With
      growing dread the passengers became aware of alarming signs all around
      them: a bundle of clothing, an open valise, some shaving brushes and
      enamelled kitchenware lying here and there on the square that had
      obviously been hastily swept a few minutes before their arrival. How had
      they come there? And why was it that just beyond the station the railway
      line ended in a stretch of sere grass and a six-metre barbed-wire fence?
      Where were the railways to Bia&#322;ystok, to Siedlce, Warsaw and
      Wo&#322;kowysk? And what accounted for the strange smile on the faces of
      the new guards as they watched the men straightening their ties, the
      neatly attired old ladies, the young boys in sailor suits, the slim
      girls who had miraculously contrived to look fresh and attractive after
      their long journey, the young mothers, who tenderly adjusted their
      infants&rsquo; blankets?

      All these guards in black uniforms and the SS non-commissioned officers
      resembled cattle drivers at the entrance to a slaughterhouse. For them
      the newly arrived group did not consist of living human beings and their
      lips curled automatically at these manifestations of embarrassment,
      love, fear, solicitude for others and concern for the safety of
      belongings. It amused them to hear mothers scolding their children for
      running off a few steps, to see the men pull out clean handkerchiefs to
      wipe their perspiring brows and light cigarettes, to watch the girls
      tucking back a stray lock and holding down their skirts when a gust of
      wind blew. It struck them as funny that the old men tried to squat down
      on suitcases, that some carried books under their arms and wore mufflers
      and scarves around their throats.

      Anything up to 20,000 people passed through Treblinka every day. Days
      when only six or seven thousand came out of the station building were
      considered wasted. The square was filled with people four and five times
      a day. And all these thousands, tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands
      of people with the frightened, questioning eyes, all these young and old
      faces, these pretty dark-haired and fair-haired girls, the stooped and
      baldheaded old men, the timid youngsters&mdash;all of them merged into a
      single flood that swept away reason, human knowledge, maidenly love,
      childish wonder, the coughing of old men and the throbbing hearts of
      living human beings.
