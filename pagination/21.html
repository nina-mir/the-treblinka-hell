      These three chambers did not have the capacity Berlin demanded. It was
      then that the construction of the building described above was begun.
      Treblinka officials took pride in the fact that their gas chambers
      surpassed those of all the other Gestapo death factories in Majdanek,
      Sobib&oacute;r and Be&#322;&#380;ec for capacity and production floor
      space.
    </p>

    <p>
      For five days 700 prisoners worked on the erection of the new death
      factory. When the work was at its height a foreman came from Germany
      with his crew and set about installing the equipment.
    </p>

    <p>
      The new gas chambers, of which there were ten in all, were built
      symmetrically on the two sides of a wide concrete-floored corridor. Like
      the old three, they each had two doors, one from the corridor for the
      live victims, and another in the opposite wall to provide an outlet for
      the corpses. The latter led to platforms running on both sides of the
      building. Narrow-gauge tracks led up to the platforms. The corpses were
      first dumped onto the platforms and then loaded into waggonettes to be
      carried to the huge burial pits the excavators dug day and night. The
      floor of the gas chambers was laid at an incline toward the platforms to
      make it easier and faster to drag out the corpses. This was a
      substantial improvement over the old chambers where the corpses had to
      be carried out on stretchers or dragged out with straps.
    </p>

    <p>
      Each new gas chamber was seven metres wide and eight long, 56 sq.m. in
      all. The area of all the new chambers totalled 560 sq.m. and the three
      old chambers, which continued to operate when there were smaller groups
      to be wiped out, brought the total lethal floor space of the Treblinka
      death factory up to 635 sq.m. From 400 to 600 were herded into each gas
      chamber at a time, which means that working at capacity the ten new
      chambers destroyed 4,000 to 6,000 lives at once.
    </p>

    <p class="page-end">
      At average operations pace the lethal chambers of the Treblinka hell
      were filled at least two or three times a day (there were days when they
      were filled as many as six times). At the lowest estimate, two loadings
      a day of the new chambers alone meant the destruction of some 10,000
      persons daily or some 300,000 every month. Treblinka was in operation
      every day for thirteen months. If however, we allow ninety days for
      stoppage, repairs and hitches in the delivery of the victims, it still
      leaves ten months of continuous operation. If the average number of
      victims a month was 300,000, in ten months Treblinka destroyed three
      million lives. Again we have the same fearful figure: three million; the
      first time we arrived at it through a deliberately low estimate of the
      number of victims brought in by train.
