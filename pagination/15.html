      The remarkable thing is that the beasts in human shape made use of
      everything&mdash;leather, paper, cloth; everything that served men was
      of use to the beasts, everything except the most precious thing on
      earth&mdash;human life. Think of all the brilliant minds, the sterling
      souls, the wonder-filled children&rsquo;s eyes, the sweet old faces, the
      proud and beautiful girlish heads to fashion which nature had toiled for
      untold ages, think of all this as a huge silent flood precipitated into
      oblivion. A few minutes sufficed to destroy that which had taken nature
      aeons of travail to evolve.
    </p>

    <p>
      The spell of illusion was broken at this point. Here at the booth ended
      the anguish of uncertainty that had kept the people in a fever of
      anxiety, causing them to pass within the space of a few minutes from
      hope to despair, from visions of life to visions of death. This torture
      by deception was part of the conveyor system at this slaughterhouse, it
      aided the SS men in their work. When the final act of robbing the living
      corpses was over, the attitude of the Germans to their victims underwent
      a sharp change. Rings were torn off unwilling fingers, and earrings
      wrenched out of ears.
    </p>

    <p>
      At this final stage, speed was important for the smooth working of the
      death conveyor. Hence the word &ldquo;Achtung&rdquo; was replaced by
      another word, a hissing, compelling word: &ldquo;Schneller! Schneller!
      Schneller! &rdquo; &ldquo;Faster! Faster! Faster into oblivion!&rdquo;
    </p>

    <p>
      Experience has shown that when stripped a man loses his power of
      resistance and ceases to resist his fate; having lost his clothes, he
      seems to lose his instinct of self-preservation and accepts what happens
      to him as the inevitable. He who a moment before wished passionately to
      live becomes passive and apathetic. In order to make doubly sure,
      however, the SS employed at this last stage of their gruesome death
      conveyor a monstrous method of stunning their victims, of reducing them
      to a state of complete mental paralysis.
    </p>

    <p>How was this done?</p>

    <p>
      By switching over suddenly to senseless and inexplicable brutality.
      These naked men and women who had been stripped of everything but who
      continued stubbornly to remain human, a thousand times more human than
      the creatures in German uniforms surrounding them, still breathed, still
      saw, still thought, their hearts still beat. Suddenly, the soap and
      towels were knocked out of their hands. They were lined up five in a row
      and marched off to the accompaniment of rapped out commands:
