      Great is the power of humanity; humanity does not die until man dies.
      And when there comes a brief but terrifying period in history, a period
      in which the beast triumphs over man, to his last breath the man slain
      by the beast retains his strength of spirit, clarity of thought and
      warmth of feeling. And the beast who slays the man remains a beast. In
      this immortal spiritual strength of human beings is a solemn martyrdom,
      the triumph of the dying man over the living beast. Therein, during the
      darkest days of 1942, lay the dawn of reason&rsquo;s victory over
      bestial madness, of good over evil, light over darkness, of the power of
      progress over the power of reaction; an awesome dawn breaking over a
      field of blood and tears, an ocean of suffering, a dawn breaking amid
      the screams and cries of perishing mothers and infants, amid the death
      rattle of the aged.

      The beasts and the philosophy of the beasts foreshadowed the end of
      Europe, the end of the world; but people remained people. They did not
      accept the morals and laws of fascism, fighting with all the means at
      their disposal against them, fighting with their death as human beings.

      I was shaken to the very depth of my being by the stories of how the
      living corpses of Treblinka up to the last minute preserved their human
      souls although they had lost everything else, how women tried to save
      their sons and for their sake accomplished feats of hopeless bravery,
      how young mothers tried to shield their infants with their bodies. No
      one knows and no one will ever know the names of these mothers. There
      are stories of little girls of ten who with divine wisdom comforted
      their sobbing mothers, of a little boy who on entering the gas chamber
      shouted: &ldquo;The Russians will avenge us, mama, don&rsquo;t
      cry!&rdquo; No one knows and no one will ever know the names of these
      children. We were told about dozens of doomed people who fought one
      against a legion of SS men armed with automatic weapons and grenades,
      and died standing up, their breasts riddled with bullets. We were told
      about the young man who stabbed an SS officer, about the lad who had
      taken part in the mutiny in the Warsaw ghetto and who by some miracle
      had managed to hide a grenade from the Germans and flung it into a group
      of executioners at the last moment. We heard about the battle that
      lasted all of one night between a group of the condemned and detachments
      of guards and SS men. The shooting and grenade explosions went on all
      through the night and when the sun rose the next morning the whole
      square was covered with the bodies of the fighters. Beside them lay
      their weapons&mdash;palings wrenched out of the fence, a knife, a razor.
      Never on this earth now will the names of these fallen fighters be
      known. We heard about the tall girl who tore a rifle out of the hands of
      a guard on the &ldquo;road from which there is no return,&rdquo; and
      fought against dozens of SS men. Two beasts were killed in that fight,
      and a third lost his arm. Terrible were the tortures to which this brave
      girl was subjected before she was finally put to death. She, too, is
      nameless.
