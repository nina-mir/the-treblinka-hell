      The excavator dug a pit 250-300 m. long, 20-25 m. wide and 6 m. deep.
      Three rows of evenly spaced reinforced concrete pillars 100-120 cm. high
      were installed across the length of the pit to support steel beams that
      were laid along them. Rails were then laid crosswise across these beams
      at intervals of five to seven centimetres. The result was the grating of
      a titanic firebox. A new narrow-gauge railway was laid from the burial
      pits to the furnace pit. Soon afterwards a second and then a third
      furnace of like dimensions were built. Each of these furnaces took 3,500
      to 4,000 corpses at a loading.

      Another huge excavator arrived, followed soon afterward by a third. Work
      went on day and night. People who took part in the work of cremating the
      corpses say that the ovens resembled volcanoes; the frightful heat
      seared the faces of the workers, the flames leapt up to a height of
      eight to ten metres, clouds of thick black smoke reached the sky and
      hung in a heavy motionless blanket in the air. Inhabitants of the
      neighbouring villages saw the flame at night from a distance of thirty
      and forty kilometres as it curled above the pine woods surrounding the
      camp. The stench of burning flesh poisoned the whole countryside. When
      the wind blew in the direction of the Polish camp three kilometres away,
      the people there were almost asphyxiated by the frightful odour. More
      than 800 prisoners (which is more than the number of workers in the
      blast-furnace or open-hearth departments of big iron and steel plants)
      were engaged in burning the corpses. This monster workshop operated day
      and night for eight months without let up, but it could not cope with
      the millions of buried bodies. True, new batches of victims continued to
      arrive all the time, which added to the load on the furnaces.

      Trainloads were brought in from Bulgaria. The SS and the guards were
      delighted, for these people, deceived both by the Germans and the
      Bulgarian fascist government, and totally unaware of the fate awaiting
      them, brought large quantities of valuables, good food and white bread
      with them. Later trains began to come in from Grodno and Bia&#322;ystok,
      then from the rebellious Warsaw ghetto; trainloads of insurgent Polish
      peasants, workers and soldiers arrived. From Bessarabia came a group of
      Gypsies, 200 men and 800 women and children. They came on foot with
      their caravans; they too had been deceived and that is why two guards
      were able to bring 1,000 people, the guards themselves having no idea
      they were leading them to their death. Witnesses say that the Gypsy
      women clapped their hands in delight at the sight of the handsome
      building of the death house and up to the last minute had no inkling of
      what awaited them, a fact which amused the Germans tremendously.
