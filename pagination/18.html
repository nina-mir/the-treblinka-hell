     On either side of the temple of death ran narrow-gauge lines over which
      men in loose overalls pushed small self-dumping waggonettes.
    </p>

    <p>
      The wide door of the slaughterhouse opened slowly and two of the
      assistants of Schmitt, the chief of the death factory, appeared at the
      entrance. These were sadists and maniacs. One, aged about thirty, was
      tall with massive shoulders, dark hair and a swarthy face beaming with
      excitement; the other, slightly younger, was short, brown-haired, with a
      pasty, jaundiced complexion. The names of these traitors to mankind are
      known.
    </p>

    <p>
      The tall one held a heavy piece of gas piping, about a metre long, and a
      whip. The second carried a sabre.
    </p>

    <p>
      At this moment the SS men released the dogs who in obedience to careful
      training threw themselves on the crowd and dug their teeth into the bare
      flesh of the doomed people. With savage cries the SS men brought their
      rifle butts down on the women, who stood rooted to the spot with terror.
    </p>

    <p>
      Inside the building Schmitt&rsquo;s men drove the victims into the gas
      chambers.
    </p>

    <p class="page-end">
      At that moment Kurt Franz, one of the Treblinka commandants, would
      appear, leading his dog Bari on a leash. Bari had been trained by his
      master to tear out the victims&rsquo; sex organs. Kurt Franz had made
      quite a career for himself in the camp. Beginning as a junior
      non-commissioned SS officer, he had been promoted to the fairly high
      rank of an Untersturmf&uuml;hrer. This tall, skinny thirty-five-year-old
      SS man not only displayed organizing abilities, not only loved his work
      and imagined no occupation for which he was better suited than the
      supervision of Treblinka, but, in addition to all this, he was something
      of a theoretician and loved to generalize and explain the meaning and
      significance of his work. It would have been a good thing if during
      these terrible moments the Pope and Mr. Brailsford and all the other
      humane defenders of Hitlerism had come to the gas chambers in the
      capacity of spectators, of course. They would have been able to add new
      arguments to their humanitarian preachings, books and articles.
      Incidentally, the Holy Father, who so benignly kept silent while Himmler
      was committing his atrocities against mankind, would have been able to
      calculate the number of batches in which the Germans could have put his
      whole Vatican through Treblinka.
