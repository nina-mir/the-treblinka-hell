      Today the witnesses have spoken, the very stones and earth have cried
      aloud. And now, before the conscience of the whole world, before the
      eyes of all mankind, we can reconstruct step by step a picture of the
      Treblinka hell, compared to which Dante&rsquo;s inferno was a harmless
      satanic frolic.
    </p>

    <p>
      Everything recorded here has been compiled from the accounts of living
      witnesses, the testimony of people who worked in Treblinka from the
      first day of its existence until August 2, 1943, when the doomed people
      who made up its population rose up against their executioners, set fire
      to the camp and escaped into the woods, and from the testimony of
      apprehended guards who bit by bit confirmed and in many respects
      supplemented the stories of the eye-witnesses. I have seen these people
      and heard their stories and have their written testimony before me as I
      write this. All this voluminous evidence emanating from so many
      different sources dovetails in every respect, beginning with the
      description of the habits of Bari, the commandant&rsquo;s dog, and
      ending with the technology of murder and the mechanism of the death
      conveyor.
    </p>

    <p>Let me conduct you through the hell on earth that was Treblinka.</p>

    <p>
      Who were the people brought here by the trainload? Mainly Jews, and to a
      lesser extent Poles and Gypsies.

      By the spring of 1942 almost the entire Jewish population of Poland,
      Germany and the western districts of Byelorussia had been rounded up in
      ghettos. Millions of Jewish workers, artisans, doctors, professors,
      architects, engineers, teachers, art workers and other professionals
      together with their wives and children, mothers and fathers lived in the
      ghettos of Warsaw, Radom, Cz&#281;stochowa, Lublin, Bia&#322;ystok,
      Grodno and dozens of other smaller towns. In the Warsaw ghetto alone
      there were about 500,000 Jews. Confinement to the ghetto was evidently
      the first preparatory stage of the Hitler plan for the extermination of
      the Jews.
    </p>

    <p>
      The summer of 1942 was chosen as the most suitable time to effect the
      second stage of the plan: physical extermination.

      Himmler came to Warsaw and issued orders. The work of preparing the
      Treblinka slaughterhouse proceeded without a stop, day and night. In
      July, the first trainloads were on their way to Treblinka from Warsaw
      and Cz&#281;stochowa. The victims were told that they were being taken
      to the Ukraine for farm work, and were permitted to take twenty
      kilograms of baggage and food with them. In many cases the Germans
      forced their victims to purchase railway tickets to the station of
      Ober-Majdan, their code name for Treblinka. The code name was adopted
      because Treblinka soon acquired such fearful notoriety throughout Poland
      that it had to be dropped. The treatment of the victims, however, was
      such as to leave little doubt in their minds as to the fate in store for
      them. No less than 150 persons, and in most cases, 180 to 200, were
      crowded into each box car. They were given nothing to drink throughout
      the journey, which sometimes lasted two or three days. People suffered
      so from thirst that many were reduced to drinking their own urine. The
      guards offered a mouthful of water for 100 z&#322;oty, but usually
      pocketed the money without giving anything in return. The prisoners were
      packed so tightly that each trip, especially in hot weather, almost
      always took a toll of several old people and persons with heart
      ailments. Inasmuch as the doors were sealed throughout the journey, the
      bodies would begin to decompose, befouling the already nauseating air.
      It was enough for any of the prisoners to strike a match during the
      night for the guards to fire through the walls of the car. Abram Kohn, a
      barber, states that five persons in his car were killed and many wounded
      as a result of such shooting.
