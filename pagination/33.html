      Treblinka ceased to exist on August 2. The Germans completed the burning
      of the remaining corpses, dismantled the brick buildings, removed the
      barbed wire, set fire to the wooden barracks that had survived the
      mutiny. The equipment of the death factory was blown up or dismantled
      and shipped away; the furnaces were destroyed, the excavators taken away
      and the huge innumerable ditches filled in with earth. The station
      building was razed to the last brick; the railway track and even the
      ties were removed. Lupine was planted on the site of the camp and a
      settler named Straben built himself a house there. The house is no
      longer there, for it has been burnt down since.

      What was the object of all this destruction? Was it to hide the traces
      of the murder of millions of people in the hell of Treblinka? But how
      did they expect to do this? Did they really think it possible to force
      the thousands who had witnessed the death trains moving from all corners
      of Europe to the death conveyor to keep silent? Did they believe they
      could hide that deadly flame and the smoke which hung for eight months
      in the sky, visible by day and by night to the inhabitants of dozens of
      villages and small towns? Did they think they could make the peasants of
      the Wulka village forget the fearful shrieks of the women and children
      which lasted for thirteen long months and which seem to ring in their
      ears to this very day? Did they imagine they could compel the peasants
      who had strewn the roads with human ashes for a whole year to keep
      silent? Did they imagine that they could compel to silence the survivors
      who had seen the Treblinka slaughterhouse in operation from its
      inception until August 2, 1943, the last day of its existence; the
      witnesses who have given accurate and corroborated accounts of every SS
      man and guard; witnesses who, step by step, have helped to reproduce a
      faithful picture of life in Treblinka from day to day? These can no
      longer be ordered: &ldquo;M&uuml;tzen ab!&rdquo;, these can no longer be
      led off to the lethal chamber. And Himmler no longer has power over
      these henchmen of his who with bowed heads and fingers that tug
      nervously at the edges of their jackets recount in dull toneless voices
      the delirium-like story of their crimes.

      A Soviet officer wearing the green ribbon of the Stalingrad Medal takes
      down page after page of the assassins&rsquo; depositions. At the door
      stands a sentry, his lips pressed tight. The same Stalingrad Medal hangs
      on his chest. His gaunt, weather-beaten face is grim. It is the face of
      popular justice. How symbolical&nbsp;it is, actually, that one of the
      victorious Stalingrad armies has come here to Treblinka, near Warsaw! It
      was not for nothing that Heinrich Himmler rushed to Treblinka by plane
      in February 1943, not for nothing that he ordered furnaces to be built
      and the traces to be burned and wiped out. No, it was to no purpose that
      he hurried so! The Stalingrad fighters came to Treblinka; the road from
      the Volga to the Vistula proved short. Now the very soil of Treblinka
      refuses to be an accomplice in the crime, in the atrocities that have
      been committed, and it spews forth the bones and the belongings of the
      murdered victims, whom the Hitlerites so vainly tried to hide in its
      depths.
