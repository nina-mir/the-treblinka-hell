      Not always, however, did things go so smoothly. There were cases when
      prisoners who knew where they were being taken mutinied. A peasant by
      the name of Skrzeminski saw people smash their way out of two trains,
      knock down the guards and run for the forest. In both cases everyone of
      the fugitives was killed. Four children between the ages of four and six
      were killed with them. Similar cases of skirmishes between the victims
      and the guards were described by a peasant woman named Marianna Kobus.
      Working in the fields one day she saw sixty people break away from a
      train and make for the forest. They were all shot down before her eyes.

      In the meantime the group inside the camp had passed on to another
      square, already beyond the second camp barrier. On this square stood a
      huge barrack-like building, and to the right of it, three other
      barracks, two for storing clothing and the third for footwear. On the
      west side of the camp were the buildings housing the SS men and guards,
      food stores, stables, and automobiles, trucks and an armoured car. The
      general impression was that of the usual concentration camp.

      In the southeastern corner of the camp grounds, fenced off by branches,
      was a compound with a booth bearing the sign &quot;Infirmary&quot; in
      front. All the feeble and sick were separated from the crowd waiting for
      the bath and carried off on stretchers to this infirmary, where a man
      wearing the white doctor&#39;s smock and a red-cross band on his left
      arm met them. What happened inside the infirmary I shall describe later
      on.

      The next step in handling the new arrivals was to break their will by
      barking curt rapid-fire commands at them with the German &quot;r&quot;
      sounding like a whiplash, an accomplishment of which the German army is
      inordinately proud and which is regarded as one of the proofs that the
      Germans belong to the &quot;master race.&quot;

      &quot;Achtung!&quot; the command would ring over the crowd and in the
      leaden silence the voice of the Scharf&uuml;hrer would be heard issuing
      instructions repeated several times a day for many months on end:
