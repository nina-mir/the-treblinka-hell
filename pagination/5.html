      Within three kilometres of the labour camp the Germans built a
      slaughterhouse for Jews. Construction was started in May, 1942, and
      proceeded at a rapid pace with more than a thousand workers on the job.
      Everything in this camp was adapted for death. It was Himmler&#39;s
      intention to keep this camp a dead secret. Not a single human being was
      to leave it alive. And no outsider was permitted to approach the place.
      Anybody who chanced within a kilometre of the camp was shot at without
      warning. Luftwaffe craft were forbidden to fly over this area. The
      victims brought hither by trainloads over a special branch line were
      ignorant of the fate awaiting them up to the last moment. The guards
      escorting the trains were not allowed inside the camp grounds; SS men
      took over the trains at a distance of two hundred metres from the camp.
      The trains, usually consisting of sixty cars, would be divided into
      three sections in the woods outside the camp and the locomotive would
      haul twenty cars at a time up to the camp platform, shunting them from
      behind so as to stop outside the barbed-wire fence. Thus neither a
      locomotive engineer nor a fireman ever crossed the boundary line. When
      one batch of cars had been unloaded, the non-commissioned SS officer on
      duty would signal for the next twenty cars. When all sixty cars were
      empty, the camp officials would telephone to the railway station for the
      next train, while the empty train would proceed further up the line to
      the sand pit, where it would load up with sand and pull out for
      Treblinka and Malkinia.

      Treblinka was well located. Trainloads of victims came here from all the
      four points of the compass&mdash;West, East, North and South. Trains
      pulled in from the Polish cities of Warsaw, Mi&#281;dzyrzecze,
      Cz&#281;stochowa, Siedlec, Radom; from &#321;om&#380;a, Bia&#322;ystok,
      Grodno and many Byelorussian towns; from Germany, Czechoslovakia,
      Austria, Bulgaria and Bessarabia.

      For thirteen months the trains rolled in to Treblinka. Each train
      consisted of sixty cars, and on each car were chalked the figures 150,
      180 or 200, depending on the number of people inside. Railway workers
      and peasants secretly kept count of these trains. Kazimierz
      Skar&#380;y&#324;ski, a sixty-two-year-old peasant from the village of
      Wulka (the inhabited point nearest to the camp), told me that on some
      days as many as six trains would pass along the Siedlce line alone and
      hardly a day passed throughout these thirteen months without at least
      one train passing by. And yet the Siedlce line was but one of the four
      railways supplying Treblinka. Lucjan &#379;ukowa, a railway section hand
      mobilized by the Germans for work on the line between Treblinka and Camp
      No. 2, said that from one to three trains were sent up to the camp from
      Treblinka every day between June 15, 1942, and August 1943, the period
      he worked there. Each train had sixty cars and in each car there were no
      less than one hundred and fifty people. We are in possession of dozens
      of similar statements. Even if we were to cut the figures cited by
      witnesses of the movement of trains to Treblinka by one half, the number
      of people brought there during the thirteen months would amount to
      something like three million.
