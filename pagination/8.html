      The trains that came to Treblinka from the West-European
      countries&mdash;France, Bulgaria, Austria and others&mdash;were another
      matter entirely. These people had not heard of Treblinka and up to the
      last minute they believed they were being sent to work. The Germans
      painted alluring pictures of the pleasures and conveniences of the new
      life awaiting the settlers. Some trains brought people who thought they
      were being taken to some neutral country. Victims of a gruesome hoax,
      they had paid the German authorities large sums of money for passports
      and foreign visas.
    </p>

    <p>
      Once a train arrived in Treblinka with Canadian, American and Australian
      citizens who had been stranded in Europe and Poland when the war broke
      out. After lengthy negotiations involving the payment of huge bribes,
      they had succeeded in gaining permission to travel to neutral countries.
    </p>

    <p>
      All the trains from the West-European countries were unguarded and
      provided with the normal sleepers and dining-cars. The passengers had
      large trunks and valises with them and abundant supplies of food, and
      when the trains stopped at stations the travellers&rsquo; children would
      run out to ask how far it was to Ober-Majdan.
    </p>

    <p>
      There were occasional trainloads of Gypsies from Bessarabia and
      elsewhere. Several trains brought young Polish peasants and workers who
      had taken part in uprisings and fought in partisan detachments.
    </p>

    <p>
      It is hard to say which is worse: to go to one&rsquo;s death in terrible
      agony, knowing that the end is near, or to gaze calmly and
      unsuspectingly out of the window of a comfortable coach at the very
      moment when a phone call is being put through from Treblinka to the camp
      announcing the time of the train&rsquo;s arrival and giving the number
      of people in it.
    </p>

    <p class="page-end">
      To keep up the farce at the expense of the people coming from Western
      Europe until the very last moment, the railhead at the death camp was
      got up to look like a railway station. The platform at which each batch
      of twenty cars was unloaded had a regular station building with ticket
      offices, a baggage room, a restaurant and arrows pointing in all
      directions with the signs: &ldquo;To Bia&#322;ystok,&rdquo; &ldquo;To
      Baranowicze,&rdquo; &ldquo;To Wo&#322;kowysk,&rdquo; etc. As the trains
      pulled in a band of well-dressed musicians struck up a tune. A station
      guard in railway uniform collected the tickets from the passengers,
      letting them through to a large square.
