      They were marched down a straight avenue about 120 metres long and two
      wide, and bordered by flowers and firs. This path led to the place of
      execution.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wire was stretched along either side of the path, which was lined by
      guards in black uniforms and SS men in grey standing shoulder to
      shoulder. The path was covered with white sand and as the victims
      marched forward with upraised arms they saw the fresh imprint of bare
      feet on the sand: the small footprints of women, the tiny footprints of
      children, the impress of heavy aged feet. These faint tracks on the sand
      were all that remained of the thousands of people who had recently
      passed down this path just as the present four thousand were passing now
      and as the next four thousand would pass two hours later and the
      thousands more waiting there on the railway track in the woods. Passed
      as they had the day before, ten days before, as they would pass tomorrow
      and fifty days hence, as they had passed throughout the thirteen months
      of the existence of the hell at Treblinka.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Germans called it &quot;the road from which there is no
      return.&quot;
    </p>

    <p>
      Smirking and grimacing, a fiend in human shape whose name was Suckhomil,
      ran alongside shouting in deliberately distorted German: &quot;Now then,
      lads, faster, faster! Your bath water is cooling. Schneller, Kinder,
      schneller!&quot;
    </p>

    <p>
      And bursting into loud guffaws the creature danced in a frenzy of
      delight. The victims moved on in silence with upraised arms between the
      two rows of guards, who beat them with rifle butts and rubber truncheons
      as they went by. Children ran to keep up with the grown-ups.
    </p>

    <p>
      The brutality of one of the fiends, an SS man called Zepf, especially
      impressed itself on all who witnessed this mournful procession. Zepf
      specialized in child-killing. Endowed with unusual physical strength,
      this creature would suddenly snatch up a child from the ranks and either
      dash out his brains by flinging him against the ground or tear him in
      two.
    </p>
    <p class="page-end">
      When I heard about this creature who had evidently been born of a woman
      I could not believe the unimaginable and incredible things that were
      told of him. But when these stories were repeated to me by people who
      had seen with their own eyes, I believed and I realized that what they
      had seen was merely one of the details that fitted perfectly into the
      whole gruesome picture of Treblinka.
