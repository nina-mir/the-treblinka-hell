      In the meantime two hundred workers with pale-blue arm bands were busy
      on the station square silently, swiftly, deftly untying bundles, opening
      suitcases and baskets, removing straps from bedrolls. The possessions of
      the new arrivals were being sorted out and appraised. Neatly packed
      darning sets flew on the ground, skeins of thread, children&rsquo;s
      panties, shirts, sheets, jumpers, pocketknives, shaving sets, packets of
      letters, photographs, thimbles, bottles of perfume, mirrors, night caps,
      shoes, warm boots, ladies&rsquo; slippers, stockings, lace, pyjamas,
      parcels of butter, coffee, cans of cocoa, prayer robes, candlesticks,
      books, rusks, violins, children&rsquo;s blocks. It required considerable
      skill to sort out and classify within the space of a few minutes all
      these thousand and one articles, some for sending to Germany, the old
      and valueless to be laid aside for burning. Woe to the blundering worker
      who placed an old fibre suitcase on the pile of leather valises intended
      for shipment to Germany, or who threw a new pair of silk stockings with
      a Paris trade mark on a heap of old mended socks! Such a blunder could
      be made only once. The workers were not allowed to make the same mistake
      twice.

      Forty SS men and sixty guards worked on &ldquo;transport,&rdquo; as the
      first stage of the Treblinka tragedy was called. Their work involved
      meeting the trains, leading the passengers out of the
      &ldquo;station&rdquo; to the square, and watching over the workers who
      sorted and classified the possessions. While they worked the men with
      the pale-blue arm bands often popped into their mouths bits of bread,
      sugar or candies found in the baggage they were sorting, but they made
      sure that the guards did not see them for this was strictly forbidden.
      It was permitted, however, to wash up after the job was finished with
      eau de Cologne and perfume, for there was a shortage of water in
      Treblinka and only the Germans were permitted to use water for washing.

      While the people were still preparing for their bath, the sorting of
      their possessions was being completed. The valuable articles were
      carried away to the warehouses, and the letters, photographs of newborn
      babies, brothers and brides, yellowed wedding announcements, all these
      precious bits of paper that had been treasured by their owners perhaps
      for years and that were just so much trash to the Treblinka officials,
      were collected in a pile and carted away to huge pits already partly
      filled with hundreds of thousands of similar letters, postcards,
      visiting cards, photographs, letters written in shaky childish
      handwriting and crude childish crayon drawings.

      After a brief, hurried sweeping the square was ready to receive the next
      group of unfortunates.
