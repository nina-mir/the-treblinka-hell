      One group was given the task of storming the watch towers, where the
      guards sat behind machine guns. Other groups were to attack the sentries
      on duty at the entrances to the camp grounds. Others were to tackle the
      armoured cars, to cut telephone communications, to attack the barracks,
      to cut passages through the barbed wire, to lay bridges across the
      anti-tank ditches, to pour gasolene on the camp buildings, to set fire
      to them and to destroy everything that lent itself easily to
      destruction.

      The plan even provided for the supply of money to the escaped prisoners.
      A Warsaw doctor who collected the money nearly gave the whole show away.
      One day a Scharf&uuml;hrer noticed a fat bundle of banknotes sticking
      out of his pocket&mdash;it was the current sum the doctor had intended
      to hide. The Scharf&uuml;hrer pretended not to have noticed it and
      reported the matter to Franz. Franz decided to question the doctor
      himself. He suspected something immediately. Why should a doomed man
      need money? Franz proceeded to cross-examine his victim with calm
      deliberation; he was convinced no person on earth could equal him in
      torturing a victim. But the Warsaw doctor outwitted the SS Hauptmann. He
      took poison. One of the participants in the uprising told me that never
      in Treblinka had such efforts been made to save a man&rsquo;s life.
      Evidently Franz realized that the dying doctor would carry his secret
      with him. But the German poison worked well and the secret remained
      unrevealed.

      Toward the end of July the heat became unbearable. Steam issued from the
      graves when they were opened as from gigantic boilers. The terrific
      stench and the heat of the furnaces killed men who toiled on the burning
      of the corpses. They dropped dead, falling headlong into the blazing
      furnace. Thousands of millions of fat-bellied flies crawled along the
      ground or filled the air with their monotonous drone. The last hundred
      thousand corpses were being burned.

      The uprising was scheduled for August 2. A revolver shot was its signal.
      Fortune favoured the sacred cause of the rebels. A new flame leapt
      skywards, not the thick heavy black smoke and flame of burning bodies,
      but the bright, hot and dancing flame of a conflagration. The camp
      buildings flared up and to the rebels it seemed that the sun had rent
      itself asunder and was burning over Treblinka, a symbol of the triumph
      of freedom and honour.
