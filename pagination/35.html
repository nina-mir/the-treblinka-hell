      We walk over the bottomless Treblinka earth and suddenly something
      causes us to halt in our tracks. It is the sight of a lock of hair
      gleaming like burnished copper, the soft lovely hair of a young girl
      trampled into the ground, and next to it a lock of light blonde hair,
      and farther on a thick dark braid gleaming against the light sand; and
      beyond that more and more. These are evidently the contents of one, but
      only one, of the sacks of hair the Germans had neglected to ship off.
    </p>

      Then it is all true! The last wild hope that it might be a ghastly
      nightmare has gone. The lupine pods pop open, the tiny peas beat a faint
      tattoo as though a myriad of tiny bells were really ringing a funeral
      dirge deep down under the ground. And it seems the heart must surely
      burst under the weight of sorrow, grief and pain that is beyond human
      endurance.
    </p>

      Scientists, sociologists, criminologists, psychiatrists and philosophers
      are puzzling over this phenomenon. What is it&mdash;innate or
      hereditary, is it the result of upbringing, environment, external
      influences, is it predetermined by history or is it the criminal will of
      the leaders? What is it, how did it come to pass? The embryonic traits
      of the race theory which sounded so comical when expounded by
      second-rate pseudo-professors or the puny provincial theoreticians of
      last-century Germany, the contempt of the German philistine for the
      Russian, the Pole, the Jew, the French, the British, the Greek and the
      Czech, the whole of this cheap and tawdry German superiority over the
      rest of mankind that was good-naturedly laughed off by journalists and
      humorists, was suddenly in the course of a few years transformed from
      mere childish babble into a deadly menace to mankind, a menace to life
      and freedom and became the source of incredible and unparalleled
      suffering, bloodshed and crime. There is definite food for thought here.

      Wars like the present are terrible indeed. Rivers of innocent blood have
      been spilt by the Germans. But today it is not enough to speak of the
      responsibility of Germany for what has happened. Today we must speak of
      the responsibility of all nations and of every citizen in the world for
      the future.
    </p>

    <p>
      Every man and woman today is in duty bound to his conscience, to his son
      and his mother, to his country and to mankind to examine his heart and
      conscience and reply to the question: what is it that gave rise to
      racism, what can be done in order that Nazism, Hitlerism may never rise
      again, either on this or the other side of the ocean, never unto
      eternity.
    </p>

    <p>
      The imperialist idea of national, race, or any other exceptionalism led
      the Hitlerites logically to Majdanek, Sobib&oacute;r, Be&#322;zec,
      O&#347;wi&#281;cim and Treblinka.
    </p>

    <p>
      We must remember that racism, fascism will emerge from this war not only
      with bitter recollections of defeat but also with sweet memories of the
      ease with which it is possible to slaughter millions of defenceless
      people.

      This must be solemnly borne in mind by all who value honour, liberty and
      the life of all nations, of all mankind.
