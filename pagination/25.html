      AT THE END&nbsp;of the winter of 1943 Himmler came to Treblinka escorted
      by a group of important Gestapo officials. Himmler and his party landed
      by plane near the camp and drove in two cars through the main entrance.
      Most of the visitors wore army uniforms. A few, evidently experts of
      some kind, wore civilian clothes, fur coats and hats.
    </p>

    <p>
      Himmler inspected the camp in person and one of the people who saw him
      told us that the minister of death walked over to one of the huge
      ditches and stared into it for a long time. Those who accompanied him
      stood at a respectful distance waiting while Heinrich Himmler
      contemplated the colossal grave already half-filled with corpses.
      Treblinka was the Himmler firm&rsquo;s biggest factory.
    </p>

    <p>
      The SS Reichsf&uuml;hrer left the camp the same day. Before his
      departure Himmler issued an order to the camp command that dumbfounded
      them all&mdash;Hauptsturmf&uuml;hrer Baron von Pfein; his assistant
      Korol, and Captain Franz. The order was to proceed immediately to burn
      all the buried corpses, every single one of them, and to carry the ashes
      and residue out of the camp and strew them over the fields and roads.
      Inasmuch as there were already millions of corpses in the ground this
      seemed an incredibly difficult task. Moreover, the freshly killed
      victims were not to be buried but burned at once.
    </p>

    <p>
      What was the reason for Himmler&rsquo;s visit of inspection and his
      peremptory personal order? There was only one reason&mdash;the Red
      Army&rsquo;s victory at Stalingrad. The power of the Russian blow on the
      Volga must have been smashing indeed if a few days after it was
      delivered Berlin began to think of responsibility and retribution, if
      Himmler flew to Treblinka in person and issued orders calculated to hide
      the traces of the crimes committed within sixty kilometres of Warsaw.
      Such was the repercussion of the mighty blow the Russians dealt the
      Germans on the Volga.
    </p>

    <p>
      At first there was considerable trouble with the cremation; the bodies
      would not burn. True, it was observed that the bodies of the women
      burned better. Large quantities of gasolene and oil were used up, but
      this was expensive and in any case the effect was insignificant. Things
      began to look serious, when there arrived from Germany a thickset SS man
      of about fifty, an expert in his line.
    </p>

    <p>
      One cannot but marvel at the experts begotten by the Hitler
      regime&mdash;there were expert baby killers, expert stranglers, expert
      gas chamber designers and experts who specialized in the scientifically
      organized destruction of large cities in the course of a single day. So,
      too, an expert specializing in exhuming and burning millions of human
      bodies was found.

      Under his direction they began to build furnaces. These were a special
      type of furnace, for neither the Lublin furnaces nor those of the
      largest crematorium in the world could ever have handled such a gigantic
      number of corpses in so short a time as was required at Treblinka.
