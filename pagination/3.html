      Camp No. 1 existed from the autumn of 1941 to July 23, 1944. It was
      completely destroyed when the prisoners could already hear the distant
      rumble of Soviet guns.
    </p>

      Early in the morning of July 23, the guards and SS men took a stiff
      drink and set to work to wipe out all trace of the camp. By nightfall
      all the inmates had been killed and buried. Only one man
      survived&mdash;Max Levit, a Warsaw carpenter, who was only wounded and
      lay beneath the bodies of his comrades until nightfall, when he crawled
      off into the forest. He told us how as he lay there at the bottom of the
      pit he heard a group of some thirty young lads singing a popular Soviet
      song, &ldquo;Vast Is My Native Land,&rdquo; before being shot down;
      heard one of the boys cry out: &ldquo;Stalin will avenge us!&rdquo;;
      heard the boys&rsquo; leader, young Leib, who had been everyone&rsquo;s
      favourite in the camp, scream after the first volley: &ldquo;Panie
      Watchman, you didn&rsquo;t kill me! Shoot again, please! Shoot
      again!&rdquo;

      It is now possible to reconstruct the picture of the German regime in
      this labour camp from the accounts of dozens of witnesses&mdash;Polish
      men and women who escaped or were released from it at one time or
      another. We know how they worked in the sand pit; we know that those who
      did not fulfil their quota of work were pushed over the edge of a cliff
      into the abyss below. We know that the workers received a food ration of
      170-200 grams of bread and a litre of some indescribable liquid which
      passed for soup; we know of the deaths from starvation, of the
      hunger-swollen wretches who were taken outside the camp on wheelbarrows
      and shot. We know of the savage orgies in which the Germans indulged; we
      know that they raped girls and shot them immediately afterwards; that
      they pushed people off a tower six metres high; that drunken Germans
      broke into the barracks at night, grabbed ten or fifteen prisoners and
      calmly commenced to demonstrate their adeptness in murdering their
      victims by shooting through the heart, the back of the head, the eye,
      the mouth or the temple. We know the names of the SS men in this camp,
      we know their characters andidiosyncracies. We know about the chief of
      the camp, a Dutch German named Van Eipen, an insatiable murderer and sex
      pervert who had a passion for good horses and reckless riding. We know
      about the massively-built young Stumpfe who was invariably overcome by a
      paroxysm of uncontrollable laughter whenever he killed anyone or when
      executions were carried out in his presence. &quot;Laughing Death&quot;
      they called him, and Max Levit was the last to hear him laugh as he lay
      at the bottom of the pit on July 23, 1944, when the boys were shot at
      Stumpfe&#39;s orders.
