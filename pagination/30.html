      The peasants carted the charred bones and ashes from the spring of 1943
      until the summer of 1944. Every day twenty carts went out, each one
      making six or eight trips in the course of the day. In every load went
      100-125 kilograms of ashes and charred bones.

      In the &ldquo;Treblinka&rdquo; song the Germans forced the eight hundred
      corpse-burners to sing were words exhorting the prisoners to humbleness
      and obedience in reward for which they were promised &ldquo;a tiny bit
      of happiness which passes in a flash.&rdquo; Surprisingly enough there
      actually was one happy day in the Treblinka inferno. The Germans,
      however, were mistaken: neither obedience nor humility gave that day to
      the Treblinka doomed. It was the reckless courage of the brave that
      brought it into being.

      They had nothing to lose. They were all doomed, every day of their lives
      was hell. Not one of the witnesses of the frightful crimes would have
      been spared. The gas chamber awaited them one and all; in fact most of
      them were killed after working for a few days and replaced by new
      workers from the current groups of victims. Only a few dozen men lived
      weeks and months instead of days and hours. These were skilled workers,
      carpenters, stone-masons, or the bakers, tailors and barbers who served
      the Germans. It was they who formed a committee of revolt. Only
      condemned men, only men possessed by an all-consuming hatred and a
      fierce thirst for revenge could have conceived such a mad plan of
      revolt. They did not want to escape before destroying Treblinka. And
      they destroyed it.

    <p class="page-end">
      Weapons&mdash;axes, knives, truncheons&mdash;began to appear in the
      workers&rsquo; barracks. At what a price, at what a tremendous risk was
      each axe and knife procured! What incredible patience, cunning and skill
      was required to hide all this from the Argus eyes of the guards! The
      workers laid in stocks of gasolene to use for setting fire to the camp
      buildings. How did this gasolene accumulate and how did it disappear
      without trace as if it had evaporated into thin air? By superhuman
      effort, great mental strain, will power and fierce daring. A tunnel was
      then dug underneath the German arsenal building. Here again sheer daring
      worked miracles; the god of courage was on their side. Twenty hand
      grenades, a machine gun, rifles and pistols were carried out of the
      arsenal and secreted in hiding places known to the conspirators alone.
      The latter divided themselves into groups of five. The extraordinarily
      complex plan for the uprising was worked out to the minutest detail.
      Every group had its definite assignment. And, each of these
      mathematically perfect assignments was a piece of sheer madness in
      itself.
