      THE TERRAIN&nbsp;to the east of Warsaw along the Western Bug is an
      expanse of alternating sands and swamps interspersed with evergreen and
      deciduous forests. The landscape is drear and villages are rare. The
      narrow, sandy roads where wheels sink up to the axle and walking is
      difficult, are something for the traveller to avoid.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the midst of this desolate country stands the small out-of-the-way
      station of Treblinka on the Siedlce railway branch line. It is some
      sixty kilometres from Warsaw and not far from Ma&#322;kinia station
      where lines from Warsaw, Bia&#322;ystok, Siedlce and &#321;om&#380;a
      meet.
    </p>

    <p>
      Many of those who were brought to Treblinka in 1942 may have had
      occasion to travel this way before the war. Staring out over the
      desolate landscape of pines, sand, more sand and again pines, scrubland,
      heather, unattractive station buildings and railway crossings, the
      pre-war passenger might have allowed his bored gaze to pause for a
      moment on a single-track spur running from the station into the forest
      to disappear amid the dense pines. This spur led to a pit where white
      sand was extracted for industrial purposes.
    </p>

    <p>
      The sand pit is situated about four kilometres from the station in an
      open stretch of country surrounded on all sides by pine woods. The soil
      here is poor and barren, and the peasants do not cultivate it. And so
      the land is bare but for a few patches of moss and an occasional sickly
      pine. Now and then a jackdaw or a bright-combed hoopoe wings past, but
      no bird stops to build its nest here.
    </p>

    <p>
      This desolate wasteland is the spot Heinrich Himmler, the SS
      Reichsf&uuml;hrer, selected and approved for the site of a
      slaughterhouse the like of which the human race has not known from the
      age of primitive barbarism to these cruel days of ours. The main SS
      slaughterhouse, surpassing those at Sobib&oacute;r, Majdanek,
      Be&#322;&#380;ec and O&#347;wi&#281;cim, was located here.
    </p>

    <p>
      There were two camps in Treblinka: labour camp No. 1, where prisoners of
      various nationalities, chiefly Poles, worked, and camp No. 2 for Jews.
    </p>

    <p class="page-end">
      Camp No. 1, of the labour or punitive type, was located in the immediate
      vicinity of the sand pit, not far from the woods. It was one of the
      hundreds and thousands of similar camps the Hitlerites set up in the
      occupied countries of Eastern Europe. It came into being in 1941. In it
      the various traits of the German character, distorted in the hideous
      mirror of the Hitler regime, co-existed in a sort of frightful unity.
      Thus do the delirious ravings of a fevered mind give an ugly, distorted
      reflection of the thoughts and emotions experienced by the patient
      before his illness. Thus does a madman distort the logical behaviour and
      thoughts of the normal person. Thus does the criminal commit his crime,
      combining in that hammer blow aimed at the bridge of the victim&rsquo;s
      nose the keen eye and the firm grip of the foundry worker with a
      cold-bloodedness that is sub-human.
