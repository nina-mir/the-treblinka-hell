      Yet is that quite true? Hitlerism robbed these people of their homes and
      their lives. Hitlerism sought to wipe their names out of living memory.
      Yet every one of them, the mothers who shielded their children with
      their bodies, the children who dried their mothers&rsquo; tears, those
      who fought with knives and flung grenades, those who fell in the
      nocturnal massacre, and the naked girl who, like some ancient Greek
      goddess, fought alone against dozens&mdash;all of these people who are
      no longer among the living have preserved forever the most splendid name
      of all, the name which the pack of Hitlers and Himmlers could not
      trample underfoot, the name of Man. History will inscribe as their
      epitaph: &ldquo;They Died for Humanity.&rdquo;
    </p>

    <p>
      Inhabitants of the village of Wulka, the settlement nearest Treblinka,
      say that sometimes the shrieks of the women who were being murdered were
      so terrible that the whole village would run for miles into the forest
      to get away from the piercing maddening cries that rent the air.
      Presently the screaming would subside only to break out again as
      terrible and soul-tearing as before.... And this was repeated three and
      four times a day.
    </p>

    <p>
      I asked one of the executioners who had been taken prisoner about the
      cries. He explained that the women usually screamed when the dogs were
      unleashed on them and the whole crowd of doomed people were driven into
      the death house. &ldquo;They saw their end coming. Besides it was very
      crowded inside; they were beaten unmercifully and the dogs tore at
      them.&rdquo;
    </p>

    <p>
      The sudden silence fell when the doors of the gas chamber closed. The
      screaming broke out again when a fresh group was brought. This occurred
      twice, three times, four and sometimes five times a day. For Treblinka
      was not an ordinary slaughterhouse, it was run on the conveyor system
      copied from modern large-scale industry.

      And like any industrial enterprise, Treblinka did not always work as
      efficiently as has been described above. It developed gradually as new
      equipment and new rationalization methods were introduced. In the
      beginning there were three small gas chambers. While these were under
      construction several trainloads of victims arrived and the killing was
      done with axes, hammers and truncheons instead of fire-arms. This was
      done to prevent the surrounding population from suspecting the nature of
      the work at Treblinka. The first three concrete chambers were 5&times;5
      metres in size, i.e., they had an area of 25 sq.m. each. The height was
      190 cm. Each chamber had two doors, one to admit the living, the other
      to serve as an exit for the gassed corpses. This second door was very
      wide&mdash;approximately two and a half metres. The three chambers were
      erected on one foundation.
