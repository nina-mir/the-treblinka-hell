      We arrived at the Treblinka camp early in September, thirteen months
      after the day of the uprising. For thirteen months the slaughterhouse
      had been in operation. For thirteen months the Germans had endeavoured
      to hide the traces of its work.

      It was quiet. The tops of the pines flanking the railway track barely
      stirred. Millions of human eyes had stared out of the carriage windows
      at these pines, this sand, this old tree stump, as the train pulled
      slowly into the platform. The ashes and crushed slag on the black road
      lined in neat German fashion with whitewashed stones swished softly.
    </p>

    <p>
      We enter the camp. We are treading the soil of Treblinka. The lupine
      pods burst open at the slightest touch, burst open by themselves with a
      faint popping sound; millions of tiny peas roll on the ground. The
      rattle of the falling peas, the popping sound of the bursting pods merge
      into a soft, mournful melody like a funeral dirge&mdash;faint,
      sorrowful, gentle&mdash;issuing from the bowels of the earth. The soil,
      rich and juicy as though linseed oil had been poured on it, the
      fathomless earth of Treblinka, as oozy as the sea bottom, gives under
      your feet. This plot of land fenced off with barbed wire has consumed
      more human lives than all the oceans and seas in the world ever since
      the birth of mankind.

    <p class="page-end">
      The earth ejects crushed bones, teeth, bits of paper and clothing; it
      refuses to keep its awful secret. These things emerge from the unhealed
      wounds in the earth. There they are&mdash;the half-rotted shirts of the
      slain, the trousers, shoes, tarnished cigarette-cases, the tiny
      cogwheels of watches, penknives, shaving brushes, candlesticks,
      children&rsquo;s shoes with red pompons, towels with Ukrainian
      embroidery, lace underwear, scissors, thimbles, corsets, trusses. Out of
      another fissure in the earth crawl heaps of utensils: cups, pots,
      basins, tins, pans, aluminium mugs, bowls, children&rsquo;s bakelite
      cups.... And beyond, out of the bottomless, swollen earth, as though
      pushed forward into the light of day by some invisible hand, emerge
      half-rotted Soviet passports, notebooks with Bulgarian writing,
      photographs of children from Warsaw and Vienna, letters written in
      childish scrawl, a volume of poetry, a prayer copied on a yellowed
      fragment of paper, food ration coupons from Germany.... Hundreds of
      perfume bottles of all shapes and sizes, green, pink, blue.... Pervading
      everything is the nauseating stench of corruption, a stench that neither
      fire nor sunshine, rain, snow or wind have been able to overcome. And
      hundreds of tiny forest flies swarm over the decaying fragments of
      clothing and paper.
