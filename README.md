## biography:

The following text is from [New York Review of Books website](https://www.nyrb.com/collections/vasily-grossman)



> Vasily Semyonovich Grossman was born on December 12, 1905, in Berdichev, a Ukrainian town that was home to one of Europe’s largest Jewish communities. In 1934, he published both “In the Town of Berdichev”—a short story that won the admiration of such diverse writers as Maksim Gorky, Mikhail Bulgakov, and Isaak Babel—and a novel, Glyukauf, about the life of the Donbass miners. During the Second World War, Grossman worked as a reporter for the army newspaper Red Star, covering nearly all of the most important battles from the defense of Moscow to the fall of Berlin. His vivid yet sober “The Hell of Treblinka” (late 1944), one of the first articles in any language about a Nazi death camp, was translated and used as testimony in the Nuremberg trials. His novel For a Just Cause (originally titled Stalingrad) was published to great acclaim in 1952 and then fiercely attacked. A new wave of purges—directed against the Jews—was about to begin; but for Stalin’s death, in March 1953, Grossman would almost certainly have been arrested himself. During the next few years Grossman, while enjoying public success, worked on his two masterpieces, neither of which was to be published in Russia until the late 1980s: Life and Fate and Everything Flows. The KGB confiscated the manuscript of Life and Fate in February 1961. Grossman was able, however, to continue working on Everything Flows, a novel even more critical of Soviet society than Life and Fate, until his last days in the hospital. He died on September 14, 1964, on the eve of the twenty-third anniversary of the massacre of the Jews of Berdichev in which his mother had died.


In a period of two years millions of humans, majority Jewish people from Europe and beyond along thousands of Roma people, antifascist resistance partisans and trouble makers, infirmed and orphanced children, including, at least, 350,000 humans of Warsaw Ghetto were systematically and meticulously were butchered by Germans and their collaborators.

The Germans called the operation of transporting Jewish Poles from Warsaw Ghetto, Grossaktion Warsaw, which lasted from 22 July 1942 to 21 September 1942. 

Per an entry in Zofia Nałkowska’s diary dated 31 August 1942: The Grossaktion Warsaw had been underway for forty-one days. Close to 210,000 Jews had already been transported to Treblinka in that time.
