        THE TERRAIN&nbsp;to the east of Warsaw along the Western Bug is an
        expanse of alternating sands and swamps interspersed with evergreen and
        deciduous forests. The landscape is drear and villages are rare. The
        narrow, sandy roads where wheels sink up to the axle and walking is
        difficult, are something for the traveller to avoid.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the midst of this desolate country stands the small out-of-the-way
        station of Treblinka on the Siedlce railway branch line. It is some
        sixty kilometres from Warsaw and not far from Ma&#322;kinia station
        where lines from Warsaw, Bia&#322;ystok, Siedlce and &#321;om&#380;a
        meet.
      </p>

      <p>
        Many of those who were brought to Treblinka in 1942 may have had
        occasion to travel this way before the war. Staring out over the
        desolate landscape of pines, sand, more sand and again pines, scrubland,
        heather, unattractive station buildings and railway crossings, the
        pre-war passenger might have allowed his bored gaze to pause for a
        moment on a single-track spur running from the station into the forest
        to disappear amid the dense pines. This spur led to a pit where white
        sand was extracted for industrial purposes.
      </p>

      <p>
        The sand pit is situated about four kilometres from the station in an
        open stretch of country surrounded on all sides by pine woods. The soil
        here is poor and barren, and the peasants do not cultivate it. And so
        the land is bare but for a few patches of moss and an occasional sickly
        pine. Now and then a jackdaw or a bright-combed hoopoe wings past, but
        no bird stops to build its nest here.
      </p>

      <p>
        This desolate wasteland is the spot Heinrich Himmler, the SS
        Reichsf&uuml;hrer, selected and approved for the site of a
        slaughterhouse the like of which the human race has not known from the
        age of primitive barbarism to these cruel days of ours. The main SS
        slaughterhouse, surpassing those at Sobib&oacute;r, Majdanek,
        Be&#322;&#380;ec and O&#347;wi&#281;cim, was located here.
      </p>

      <p>
        There were two camps in Treblinka: labour camp No. 1, where prisoners of
        various nationalities, chiefly Poles, worked, and camp No. 2 for Jews.
      </p>

      <p>
        Camp No. 1, of the labour or punitive type, was located in the immediate
        vicinity of the sand pit, not far from the woods. It was one of the
        hundreds and thousands of similar camps the Hitlerites set up in the
        occupied countries of Eastern Europe. It came into being in 1941. In it
        the various traits of the German character, distorted in the hideous
        mirror of the Hitler regime, co-existed in a sort of frightful unity.
        Thus do the delirious ravings of a fevered mind give an ugly, distorted
        reflection of the thoughts and emotions experienced by the patient
        before his illness. Thus does a madman distort the logical behaviour and
        thoughts of the normal person. Thus does the criminal commit his crime,
        combining in that hammer blow aimed at the bridge of the victim&rsquo;s
        nose the keen eye and the firm grip of the foundry worker with a
        cold-bloodedness that is sub-human.
      </p>

      <p>
        The thrift, precision, calculation and pedantic cleanliness common to
        many Germans are not bad traits in themselves. Applied to agriculture or
        to industry they produce laudable results. Hitlerism applied these
        traits to crime against mankind and the Reich&rsquo;s SS behaved in the
        Polish labour camp exactly as though they were raising cauliflower or
        potatoes.
      </p>

      <p>
        The area of the camp was laid out in neat rectangles; the barracks stood
        in the straightest of rows; the paths were lined with birches and
        covered with gravel. There were concrete ponds for domestic fowl, pools
        for washing laundry with steps leading conveniently down, various
        services for the German personnel&mdash;a modern bakery, barbershop,
        garage, a gasolene-pump topped by a glass ball, warehouses. Built on
        approximately the same principle&mdash;with the gardens, the drinking
        fountains, the concrete paths&mdash;was the camp at Majdanek and dozens
        of other labour camps in East Poland where the Gestapo and the SS
        intended settling down. German precision and petty calculation, the
        pedantic fondness for orderliness, the German love for time tables and
        charts with the minutest details worked out were reflected in the layout
        of these camps.
      </p>

      <p>
        People were brought to the labour camp for brief periods, sometimes no
        more than four, five or six months. They were Poles who had violated
        laws laid down by the governor-generalship&mdash;minor violations, as a
        rule, since the penalty for major violations was immediate death. A slip
        of the tongue, a chance word overheard on the street, failure to make
        some delivery, refusal to give a cart or a horse to a German, the harsh
        word of a girl declining the amorous advances of some SS man, not
        sabotage at factories but mere suspicion of the possibility of
        sabotage&mdash;these were the offences that brought hundreds and
        thousands of Polish workers, peasants and intellectuals, men and girls,
        mothers of families, old people and juveniles, to this labour camp.
        Altogether about 50,000 people passed through its gates. Jews were sent
        there only if they happened to be skilled workers in their
        field&mdash;bakers, shoemakers, cabinet-makers, stone-masons or tailors.
        The camp had all manner of workshops, including a substantial furniture
        factory which supplied armchairs, tables and chairs to German Army
        Headquarters.
      </p>

      <p>
        Camp No. 1 existed from the autumn of 1941 to July 23, 1944. It was
        completely destroyed when the prisoners could already hear the distant
        rumble of Soviet guns.
      </p>

      <p>
        Early in the morning of July 23, the guards and SS men took a stiff
        drink and set to work to wipe out all trace of the camp. By nightfall
        all the inmates had been killed and buried. Only one man
        survived&mdash;Max Levit, a Warsaw carpenter, who was only wounded and
        lay beneath the bodies of his comrades until nightfall, when he crawled
        off into the forest. He told us how as he lay there at the bottom of the
        pit he heard a group of some thirty young lads singing a popular Soviet
        song, &ldquo;Vast Is My Native Land,&rdquo; before being shot down;
        heard one of the boys cry out: &ldquo;Stalin will avenge us!&rdquo;;
        heard the boys&rsquo; leader, young Leib, who had been everyone&rsquo;s
        favourite in the camp, scream after the first volley: &ldquo;Panie
        Watchman, you didn&rsquo;t kill me! Shoot again, please! Shoot
        again!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        It is now possible to reconstruct the picture of the German regime in
        this labour camp from the accounts of dozens of witnesses&mdash;Polish
        men and women who escaped or were released from it at one time or
        another. We know how they worked in the sand pit; we know that those who
        did not fulfil their quota of work were pushed over the edge of a cliff
        into the abyss below. We know that the workers received a food ration of
        170-200 grams of bread and a litre of some indescribable liquid which
        passed for soup; we know of the deaths from starvation, of the
        hunger-swollen wretches who were taken outside the camp on wheelbarrows
        and shot. We know of the savage orgies in which the Germans indulged; we
        know that they raped girls and shot them immediately afterwards; that
        they pushed people off a tower six metres high; that drunken Germans
        broke into the barracks at night, grabbed ten or fifteen prisoners and
        calmly commenced to demonstrate their adeptness in murdering their
        victims by shooting through the heart, the back of the head, the eye,
        the mouth or the temple. We know the names of the SS men in this camp,
        we know their characters andidiosyncracies. We know about the chief of
        the camp, a Dutch German named Van Eipen, an insatiable murderer and sex
        pervert who had a passion for good horses and reckless riding. We know
        about the massively-built young Stumpfe who was invariably overcome by a
        paroxysm of uncontrollable laughter whenever he killed anyone or when
        executions were carried out in his presence. &quot;Laughing Death&quot;
        they called him, and Max Levit was the last to hear him laugh as he lay
        at the bottom of the pit on July 23, 1944, when the boys were shot at
        Stumpfe&#39;s orders.
      </p>

      <p>
        We know Sviderski, the one-eyed German from Odessa, known as the
        &quot;hammer expert&quot; because of his consummate skill at killing
        without firearms. Within the space of a few minutes, he hammered to
        death fifteen children between the ages of eight and thirteen declared
        unfit for work. We know the skinny SS man known as &quot;old
        Preiff,&quot; a gloomy and morose individual who looked like a Gypsy.
        &quot;Old Preiff&quot; relieved the monotony of his existence by sitting
        near the garbage dump and shooting camp inmates who would steal over to
        pick up potato peels. He would force his victim to open his jaws and
        then shoot him in the mouth.
      </p>

      <p>
        We know the names of the professional murderers Schwarz and Ledeke who
        amused themselves by shooting at prisoners returning from work. They
        killed twenty to forty people every day.
      </p>

      <p>
        There was nothing human about these creatures. Warped minds, hearts and
        souls, their words, behaviour and habits were like a horrible caricature
        of the behaviour, habits, thoughts and feelings of normal Germans. The
        order that existed in the camp; the documentation of the murders; the
        predilection for monstrous practical jokes faintly reminiscent of the
        jokes of drunken German student brawls; the chorus singing of
        sentimental songs amid pools of blood; the speeches they were
        continually delivering to their doomed victims; the sermons and pious,
        neatly printed texts hung all over the place&mdash;all these were the
        monster dragons and reptiles that had sprung from the embryo of
        traditional German chauvinism, the arrogance, conceit, vanity,
        self-assurance, slobbery nest-feathering and utter indifference to the
        fate of all living beings, arising from a fierce, blind conviction that
        German science, music, poetry, language, flower beds, water closets,
        sky, beer and homes were the finest and best in the whole universe. The
        horrible vices and fearful crimes of these people were offshoots of the
        vices of the German national character.
      </p>

      <p>
        Such was the routine in this camp, this lesser Majdanek. One might think
        that there could be nothing more terrible in all the world. Yet those
        who lived in Camp No. 1 knew very well that there was something a
        hundred times more ghastly than their camp.
      </p>

      <p>
        Within three kilometres of the labour camp the Germans built a
        slaughterhouse for Jews. Construction was started in May, 1942, and
        proceeded at a rapid pace with more than a thousand workers on the job.
        Everything in this camp was adapted for death. It was Himmler&#39;s
        intention to keep this camp a dead secret. Not a single human being was
        to leave it alive. And no outsider was permitted to approach the place.
        Anybody who chanced within a kilometre of the camp was shot at without
        warning. Luftwaffe craft were forbidden to fly over this area. The
        victims brought hither by trainloads over a special branch line were
        ignorant of the fate awaiting them up to the last moment. The guards
        escorting the trains were not allowed inside the camp grounds; SS men
        took over the trains at a distance of two hundred metres from the camp.
        The trains, usually consisting of sixty cars, would be divided into
        three sections in the woods outside the camp and the locomotive would
        haul twenty cars at a time up to the camp platform, shunting them from
        behind so as to stop outside the barbed-wire fence. Thus neither a
        locomotive engineer nor a fireman ever crossed the boundary line. When
        one batch of cars had been unloaded, the non-commissioned SS officer on
        duty would signal for the next twenty cars. When all sixty cars were
        empty, the camp officials would telephone to the railway station for the
        next train, while the empty train would proceed further up the line to
        the sand pit, where it would load up with sand and pull out for
        Treblinka and Malkinia.
      </p>

      <p>
        Treblinka was well located. Trainloads of victims came here from all the
        four points of the compass&mdash;West, East, North and South. Trains
        pulled in from the Polish cities of Warsaw, Mi&#281;dzyrzecze,
        Cz&#281;stochowa, Siedlec, Radom; from &#321;om&#380;a, Bia&#322;ystok,
        Grodno and many Byelorussian towns; from Germany, Czechoslovakia,
        Austria, Bulgaria and Bessarabia.
      </p>

      <p>
        For thirteen months the trains rolled in to Treblinka. Each train
        consisted of sixty cars, and on each car were chalked the figures 150,
        180 or 200, depending on the number of people inside. Railway workers
        and peasants secretly kept count of these trains. Kazimierz
        Skar&#380;y&#324;ski, a sixty-two-year-old peasant from the village of
        Wulka (the inhabited point nearest to the camp), told me that on some
        days as many as six trains would pass along the Siedlce line alone and
        hardly a day passed throughout these thirteen months without at least
        one train passing by. And yet the Siedlce line was but one of the four
        railways supplying Treblinka. Lucjan &#379;ukowa, a railway section hand
        mobilized by the Germans for work on the line between Treblinka and Camp
        No. 2, said that from one to three trains were sent up to the camp from
        Treblinka every day between June 15, 1942, and August 1943, the period
        he worked there. Each train had sixty cars and in each car there were no
        less than one hundred and fifty people. We are in possession of dozens
        of similar statements. Even if we were to cut the figures cited by
        witnesses of the movement of trains to Treblinka by one half, the number
        of people brought there during the thirteen months would amount to
        something like three million.
      </p>

      <p>
        The fenced-in area of the camp with its warehouses for the belongings of
        the executed, platforms and other auxiliary premises occupied an
        insignificant area, 780 metres in length and 600 metres in width. If one
        were to entertain the slightest doubt as to the fate of the millions who
        were brought here, or to assume for a moment that they were not murdered
        immediately upon arrival, the question then arises: what became of all
        these people of whom there were enough to populate a small state or a
        large European capital? Where are they? For thirteen months or 396 days,
        the trains returned empty or loaded with sand; not a single one of those
        who were brought to Camp No. 2 ever returned. The time has come to ask
        the stern question: &ldquo;Cain, where are they whom thou broughtest
        hither?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Fascism did not succeed in concealing its terrible crime. But not
        because thousands of people were its unwilling witnesses. Confident that
        he could act with impunity, Hitler took the decision to exterminate
        millions of innocent people during the summer of 1942 when the Wehrmacht
        was at the zenith of its sanguinary career. It can now be proved that
        the statistics of the murders perpetrated by the Germans reach their
        highest mark in 1942. Confident that they could act with impunity, the
        fascists showed what they are capable of.
      </p>

      <p>
        Had Adolf Hitler been victorious, he would have succeeded in covering up
        all the traces of his crimes; he would have forced all the witnesses to
        be silent, even if there had been scores of thousands instead of a few
        thousand. Not one of them would have uttered a word. And once again you
        cannot help wanting to pay homage to the men who in the autumn of 1942,
        when the whole world that is now humming so noisily and victoriously was
        silent, battled in Stalingrad on the banks of the Volga against the
        German army, a river of innocent blood smoking and gurgling behind their
        backs. It was the Red Army that prevented Himmler from keeping the
        secret of Treblinka.
      </p>

      <p>
        Today the witnesses have spoken, the very stones and earth have cried
        aloud. And now, before the conscience of the whole world, before the
        eyes of all mankind, we can reconstruct step by step a picture of the
        Treblinka hell, compared to which Dante&rsquo;s inferno was a harmless
        satanic frolic.
      </p>

      <p>
        Everything recorded here has been compiled from the accounts of living
        witnesses, the testimony of people who worked in Treblinka from the
        first day of its existence until August 2, 1943, when the doomed people
        who made up its population rose up against their executioners, set fire
        to the camp and escaped into the woods, and from the testimony of
        apprehended guards who bit by bit confirmed and in many respects
        supplemented the stories of the eye-witnesses. I have seen these people
        and heard their stories and have their written testimony before me as I
        write this. All this voluminous evidence emanating from so many
        different sources dovetails in every respect, beginning with the
        description of the habits of Bari, the commandant&rsquo;s dog, and
        ending with the technology of murder and the mechanism of the death
        conveyor.
      </p>

      <p>Let me conduct you through the hell on earth that was Treblinka.</p>

      <p>
        Who were the people brought here by the trainload? Mainly Jews, and to a
        lesser extent Poles and Gypsies.
      </p>

      <p>
        By the spring of 1942 almost the entire Jewish population of Poland,
        Germany and the western districts of Byelorussia had been rounded up in
        ghettos. Millions of Jewish workers, artisans, doctors, professors,
        architects, engineers, teachers, art workers and other professionals
        together with their wives and children, mothers and fathers lived in the
        ghettos of Warsaw, Radom, Cz&#281;stochowa, Lublin, Bia&#322;ystok,
        Grodno and dozens of other smaller towns. In the Warsaw ghetto alone
        there were about 500,000 Jews. Confinement to the ghetto was evidently
        the first preparatory stage of the Hitler plan for the extermination of
        the Jews.
      </p>

      <p>
        The summer of 1942 was chosen as the most suitable time to effect the
        second stage of the plan: physical extermination.
      </p>

      <p>
        Himmler came to Warsaw and issued orders. The work of preparing the
        Treblinka slaughterhouse proceeded without a stop, day and night. In
        July, the first trainloads were on their way to Treblinka from Warsaw
        and Cz&#281;stochowa. The victims were told that they were being taken
        to the Ukraine for farm work, and were permitted to take twenty
        kilograms of baggage and food with them. In many cases the Germans
        forced their victims to purchase railway tickets to the station of
        Ober-Majdan, their code name for Treblinka. The code name was adopted
        because Treblinka soon acquired such fearful notoriety throughout Poland
        that it had to be dropped. The treatment of the victims, however, was
        such as to leave little doubt in their minds as to the fate in store for
        them. No less than 150 persons, and in most cases, 180 to 200, were
        crowded into each box car. They were given nothing to drink throughout
        the journey, which sometimes lasted two or three days. People suffered
        so from thirst that many were reduced to drinking their own urine. The
        guards offered a mouthful of water for 100 z&#322;oty, but usually
        pocketed the money without giving anything in return. The prisoners were
        packed so tightly that each trip, especially in hot weather, almost
        always took a toll of several old people and persons with heart
        ailments. Inasmuch as the doors were sealed throughout the journey, the
        bodies would begin to decompose, befouling the already nauseating air.
        It was enough for any of the prisoners to strike a match during the
        night for the guards to fire through the walls of the car. Abram Kohn, a
        barber, states that five persons in his car were killed and many wounded
        as a result of such shooting.
      </p>

      <p>
        The trains that came to Treblinka from the West-European
        countries&mdash;France, Bulgaria, Austria and others&mdash;were another
        matter entirely. These people had not heard of Treblinka and up to the
        last minute they believed they were being sent to work. The Germans
        painted alluring pictures of the pleasures and conveniences of the new
        life awaiting the settlers. Some trains brought people who thought they
        were being taken to some neutral country. Victims of a gruesome hoax,
        they had paid the German authorities large sums of money for passports
        and foreign visas.
      </p>

      <p>
        Once a train arrived in Treblinka with Canadian, American and Australian
        citizens who had been stranded in Europe and Poland when the war broke
        out. After lengthy negotiations involving the payment of huge bribes,
        they had succeeded in gaining permission to travel to neutral countries.
      </p>

      <p>
        All the trains from the West-European countries were unguarded and
        provided with the normal sleepers and dining-cars. The passengers had
        large trunks and valises with them and abundant supplies of food, and
        when the trains stopped at stations the travellers&rsquo; children would
        run out to ask how far it was to Ober-Majdan.
      </p>

      <p>
        There were occasional trainloads of Gypsies from Bessarabia and
        elsewhere. Several trains brought young Polish peasants and workers who
        had taken part in uprisings and fought in partisan detachments.
      </p>

      <p>
        It is hard to say which is worse: to go to one&rsquo;s death in terrible
        agony, knowing that the end is near, or to gaze calmly and
        unsuspectingly out of the window of a comfortable coach at the very
        moment when a phone call is being put through from Treblinka to the camp
        announcing the time of the train&rsquo;s arrival and giving the number
        of people in it.
      </p>

      <p>
        To keep up the farce at the expense of the people coming from Western
        Europe until the very last moment, the railhead at the death camp was
        got up to look like a railway station. The platform at which each batch
        of twenty cars was unloaded had a regular station building with ticket
        offices, a baggage room, a restaurant and arrows pointing in all
        directions with the signs: &ldquo;To Bia&#322;ystok,&rdquo; &ldquo;To
        Baranowicze,&rdquo; &ldquo;To Wo&#322;kowysk,&rdquo; etc. As the trains
        pulled in a band of well-dressed musicians struck up a tune. A station
        guard in railway uniform collected the tickets from the passengers,
        letting them through to a large square.
      </p>

      <p>
        Thus three to four thousand people carrying suitcases, bags and bundles
        and supporting the aged and the weak, would find themselves on this
        square. Among them were mothers who carried infants in their arms, while
        older children huddled against their skirts, staring curiously at the
        strange surroundings. There was something frightening about this square
        which had been tramped down by so many millions of human feet. With
        growing dread the passengers became aware of alarming signs all around
        them: a bundle of clothing, an open valise, some shaving brushes and
        enamelled kitchenware lying here and there on the square that had
        obviously been hastily swept a few minutes before their arrival. How had
        they come there? And why was it that just beyond the station the railway
        line ended in a stretch of sere grass and a six-metre barbed-wire fence?
        Where were the railways to Bia&#322;ystok, to Siedlce, Warsaw and
        Wo&#322;kowysk? And what accounted for the strange smile on the faces of
        the new guards as they watched the men straightening their ties, the
        neatly attired old ladies, the young boys in sailor suits, the slim
        girls who had miraculously contrived to look fresh and attractive after
        their long journey, the young mothers, who tenderly adjusted their
        infants&rsquo; blankets?
      </p>

      <p>
        All these guards in black uniforms and the SS non-commissioned officers
        resembled cattle drivers at the entrance to a slaughterhouse. For them
        the newly arrived group did not consist of living human beings and their
        lips curled automatically at these manifestations of embarrassment,
        love, fear, solicitude for others and concern for the safety of
        belongings. It amused them to hear mothers scolding their children for
        running off a few steps, to see the men pull out clean handkerchiefs to
        wipe their perspiring brows and light cigarettes, to watch the girls
        tucking back a stray lock and holding down their skirts when a gust of
        wind blew. It struck them as funny that the old men tried to squat down
        on suitcases, that some carried books under their arms and wore mufflers
        and scarves around their throats.
      </p>

      <p>
        Anything up to 20,000 people passed through Treblinka every day. Days
        when only six or seven thousand came out of the station building were
        considered wasted. The square was filled with people four and five times
        a day. And all these thousands, tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands
        of people with the frightened, questioning eyes, all these young and old
        faces, these pretty dark-haired and fair-haired girls, the stooped and
        baldheaded old men, the timid youngsters&mdash;all of them merged into a
        single flood that swept away reason, human knowledge, maidenly love,
        childish wonder, the coughing of old men and the throbbing hearts of
        living human beings.
      </p>

      <p>
        The new arrivals trembled inwardly as they sensed the strangeness of
        that cool, smug leer on the faces of the Hitlerites watching them, the
        look of a live beast that feels its superiority over a dead man. In
        those brief moments on the square the newcomers found themselves
        noticing more and more incomprehensible and alarming details.
      </p>

      <p>
        What was behind that massive six-metre wall completely covered with
        yellowing pine branches and blankets? The blankets too inspired fear:
        they were quilted or gaily coloured, silk, or in calico covers, exactly
        like those lying in the bedrolls of the newly arrived travellers. How
        had they come here? Who had brought them? And where were their owners?
        Why had they no further use for their blankets? And who were these men
        with the blue bands on their arms? They began to recall all the stories
        they had heard recently, all the terrifying rumours that had been
        whispered back and forth. No, no, it could not be! And they dismissed
        the fearful thought.
      </p>

      <p>
        This feeling of alarm lasted for a few moments, until all the passengers
        had emerged on the square. There was always a slight delay at this point
        for in every party there were crippled, lame, aged and sick people who
        had to be helped along.
      </p>

      <p>
        But now the train was empty and the square full. In a loud voice an
        Unterscharf&uuml;hrer (junior non-commissioned SS officer) instructed
        the passengers to leave all their things on the square and prepare to go
        to the bathhouse, taking along only personal papers, valuables and
        toilet accessories. No doubt a dozen questions occurred to the
        people&mdash;should they take clean underwear, might they undo their
        bundles, would their belongings not get mixed up or lost if they did?
        But some mysterious, irresistible force impelled them to hurry forward
        in silence without asking questions or turning round, impelled them
        toward the opening in the six-metre barbed-wire fence camouflaged with
        boughs.
      </p>

      <p>
        Inside they walked past tank obstacles, past the barbed-wire fence three
        times the height of a man, past an anti-tank ditch three metres wide,
        past thin coils of steel wire strewn on the ground to trip up the
        fugitive and catch him like a fly in a spiderweb, and again past a high
        barbed-wire fence. A terrible sensation of despair, a feeling of utter
        helplessness would seize the newcomer. There could be no question of
        escaping, of going back, or of fighting; from the low squat wooden
        towers the muzzles of heavy machine guns stared menacingly at them. Cry
        for help? What was the use with all these SS men and guards armed with
        tommy guns, hand grenades and pistols? Power was in their hands. Theirs
        the tanks and aircraft, the land, the towns, theirs the sky, the
        railways, the laws, the newspapers and the radio. The whole world was
        silent, crushed and enslaved by the brown-shirted gang which had seized
        power. And only in one spot, thousands of kilometres off, Soviet
        artillery was pounding away on the distant Volga bank, stubbornly
        putting into effect the great will of the Russian people to fight to the
        death for liberty, disturbing the quiet, challenging the people of the
        world to fight.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the meantime two hundred workers with pale-blue arm bands were busy
        on the station square silently, swiftly, deftly untying bundles, opening
        suitcases and baskets, removing straps from bedrolls. The possessions of
        the new arrivals were being sorted out and appraised. Neatly packed
        darning sets flew on the ground, skeins of thread, children&rsquo;s
        panties, shirts, sheets, jumpers, pocketknives, shaving sets, packets of
        letters, photographs, thimbles, bottles of perfume, mirrors, night caps,
        shoes, warm boots, ladies&rsquo; slippers, stockings, lace, pyjamas,
        parcels of butter, coffee, cans of cocoa, prayer robes, candlesticks,
        books, rusks, violins, children&rsquo;s blocks. It required considerable
        skill to sort out and classify within the space of a few minutes all
        these thousand and one articles, some for sending to Germany, the old
        and valueless to be laid aside for burning. Woe to the blundering worker
        who placed an old fibre suitcase on the pile of leather valises intended
        for shipment to Germany, or who threw a new pair of silk stockings with
        a Paris trade mark on a heap of old mended socks! Such a blunder could
        be made only once. The workers were not allowed to make the same mistake
        twice.
      </p>

      <p>
        Forty SS men and sixty guards worked on &ldquo;transport,&rdquo; as the
        first stage of the Treblinka tragedy was called. Their work involved
        meeting the trains, leading the passengers out of the
        &ldquo;station&rdquo; to the square, and watching over the workers who
        sorted and classified the possessions. While they worked the men with
        the pale-blue arm bands often popped into their mouths bits of bread,
        sugar or candies found in the baggage they were sorting, but they made
        sure that the guards did not see them for this was strictly forbidden.
        It was permitted, however, to wash up after the job was finished with
        eau de Cologne and perfume, for there was a shortage of water in
        Treblinka and only the Germans were permitted to use water for washing.
      </p>

      <p>
        While the people were still preparing for their bath, the sorting of
        their possessions was being completed. The valuable articles were
        carried away to the warehouses, and the letters, photographs of newborn
        babies, brothers and brides, yellowed wedding announcements, all these
        precious bits of paper that had been treasured by their owners perhaps
        for years and that were just so much trash to the Treblinka officials,
        were collected in a pile and carted away to huge pits already partly
        filled with hundreds of thousands of similar letters, postcards,
        visiting cards, photographs, letters written in shaky childish
        handwriting and crude childish crayon drawings.
      </p>

      <p>
        After a brief, hurried sweeping the square was ready to receive the next
        group of unfortunates.
      </p>

      <p>
        Not always, however, did things go so smoothly. There were cases when
        prisoners who knew where they were being taken mutinied. A peasant by
        the name of Skrzeminski saw people smash their way out of two trains,
        knock down the guards and run for the forest. In both cases everyone of
        the fugitives was killed. Four children between the ages of four and six
        were killed with them. Similar cases of skirmishes between the victims
        and the guards were described by a peasant woman named Marianna Kobus.
        Working in the fields one day she saw sixty people break away from a
        train and make for the forest. They were all shot down before her eyes.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the meantime the group inside the camp had passed on to another
        square, already beyond the second camp barrier. On this square stood a
        huge barrack-like building, and to the right of it, three other
        barracks, two for storing clothing and the third for footwear. On the
        west side of the camp were the buildings housing the SS men and guards,
        food stores, stables, and automobiles, trucks and an armoured car. The
        general impression was that of the usual concentration camp.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the southeastern corner of the camp grounds, fenced off by branches,
        was a compound with a booth bearing the sign &quot;Infirmary&quot; in
        front. All the feeble and sick were separated from the crowd waiting for
        the bath and carried off on stretchers to this infirmary, where a man
        wearing the white doctor&#39;s smock and a red-cross band on his left
        arm met them. What happened inside the infirmary I shall describe later
        on.
      </p>

      <p>
        The next step in handling the new arrivals was to break their will by
        barking curt rapid-fire commands at them with the German &quot;r&quot;
        sounding like a whiplash, an accomplishment of which the German army is
        inordinately proud and which is regarded as one of the proofs that the
        Germans belong to the &quot;master race.&quot;
      </p>

      <p>
        &quot;Achtung!&quot; the command would ring over the crowd and in the
        leaden silence the voice of the Scharf&uuml;hrer would be heard issuing
        instructions repeated several times a day for many months on end:
      </p>

      <p>
        &quot;The men are to remain where they are. Women and children undress
        in the buildings on the left.&quot;
      </p>

      <p>
        Here, according to witnesses, the heartrending scenes usually began. The
        instinct of maternal, conjugal, filial love told the victims that they
        were seeing one another for the last time. Handshakes, kisses,
        blessings, tears, briefly murmured words invested with all the love, all
        the anguish, all the tenderness and despair that filled them were now
        exchanged. The SS psychiatrists of death knew that these emotions had to
        be stamped out at once. The psychiatrists of death were familiar with
        the primitive laws that operate in all the slaughterhouses of the world,
        laws which in Treblinka were applied by the cattle to the human beings.
        This was one of the most critical moments, the moment when daughters
        were separated from fathers, mothers from sons, grandmothers from
        grandsons, husbands from wives.
      </p>

      <p>
        Again the words &quot;Achtung! Achtung!&quot;&nbsp;rent the air. This
        was precisely the moment when the minds of the victims had to be
        befuddled again, when a glimmer of hope had to be allowed to dawn, when
        death had to be made for a few moments to look like life.
      </p>

      <p>
        &quot;Women and children are to remove their footwear on entering the
        building,&quot; barks the same voice. &quot;Stockings are to be placed
        inside shoes. Children&#39;s stockings inside children&#39;s sandals,
        boots and shoes. Be orderly.&quot;
      </p>

      <p>
        And again: &quot;On entering the bathhouse take with you valuables,
        documents, money, soap and towel.... I repeat....&quot;
      </p>

      <p>
        Inside the women&#39;s bathhouse was a hairdressers&#39; department. As
        soon as they were undressed the women lined up to have their hair
        clipped off. Strange psychological effect: this final haircut, according
        to the testimony of the hairdressers themselves, had a reassuring effect
        on the women; it seemed to convince them that they really were about to
        take a bath. Young girls felt their close-cropped heads critically and
        asked the barber if she wouldn&#39;t please smooth out some of the
        uneven spots. The women usually calmed down after the haircut. Nearly
        all of them passed out of the dressing-room carrying a piece of soap and
        a folded towel. Some of the younger ones wept to part with their flowing
        tresses. Why were the women thus shorn? To deceive them? No, the hair
        was needed in Germany. It was a raw material....
      </p>

      <p>
        I asked many people what the Germans did with all the hair they removed
        from the heads of these living corpses. According to all the witnesses,
        the huge mountains of black, golden, chestnut hair, straight, curly and
        braided, were first disinfected and then pressed into sacks and shipped
        to Germany. All the witnesses questioned confirmed that the sacks
        containing this hair had German addresses on them. What was it used for?
        None of the camp personnel could answer this question. According to the
        written testimony of one Kohn, however, the hair was used by the navy to
        fill mattresses, to make hausers for submarines&nbsp;and for other
        similar purposes.
      </p>

      <p>
        It seems to me that this testimony requires additional confirmation;
        Grossadmiral R&auml;der, who headed the German navy in 1942, will
        furnish it.
      </p>

      <p>
        The men undressed in the yard. Of the first group of the morning
        arrivals some 150 to 300 would be selected for their physical strength
        to be used to bury the corpses. These would be killed the following day.
        The men were told to undress quickly, but were also warned to put down
        their clothes neatly, shoes, socks, underwear, coats and trousers
        separately. These things were sorted out by another team of workmen
        wearing red arm bands as distinct from the blue bands worn by the
        station team. Articles of clothing considered fit to be sent to Germany
        were taken away at once to the warehouse. All labels were carefully
        removed. The rest of the articles were burned or buried.
      </p>

      <p>
        The feeling of alarm grew, heightened by a fearful stench mingled with
        the odour of lime that assailed the nostrils. What accounted for such
        huge swarms of fat and troublesome flies? Pine woods and paved ground
        did not usually breed flies. The men began to breathe heavily; they
        started at every sound and stared hard at every trifle in search of an
        explanation, a hint that would help them to unravel the mystery and gain
        an inkling of the fate in store for them. What, for instance, were those
        gigantic excavators doing over at the southern end of the camp grounds?
      </p>

      <p>
        The next stage in the procedure began. The naked people were lined up at
        a window through which they were told to hand over their documents and
        valuables. And again the frightful, hypnotizing voice rapped out:
        &ldquo;Achtung! Achtung!&nbsp;The penalty for hiding valuables is death!
        Achtung!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        A Scharf&uuml;hrer sat in a small wooden booth. SS men and guards stood
        around him. Next to the booth were wooden boxes into which the valuables
        were thrown&mdash;one for paper-money, another for coins, a third for
        wrist watches, rings, earrings and brooches with precious stones, and
        bracelets. Documents were thrown on the ground, for no one had any
        earthly use for these documents belonging to living corpses who within
        an hour would be lying stiff and dead in a pit. The gold and valuables,
        however, were carefully sorted out; dozens of jewellers were engaged in
        ascertaining the purity of the metal and the value of the stones and
        diamonds.
      </p>

      <p>
        The remarkable thing is that the beasts in human shape made use of
        everything&mdash;leather, paper, cloth; everything that served men was
        of use to the beasts, everything except the most precious thing on
        earth&mdash;human life. Think of all the brilliant minds, the sterling
        souls, the wonder-filled children&rsquo;s eyes, the sweet old faces, the
        proud and beautiful girlish heads to fashion which nature had toiled for
        untold ages, think of all this as a huge silent flood precipitated into
        oblivion. A few minutes sufficed to destroy that which had taken nature
        aeons of travail to evolve.
      </p>

      <p>
        The spell of illusion was broken at this point. Here at the booth ended
        the anguish of uncertainty that had kept the people in a fever of
        anxiety, causing them to pass within the space of a few minutes from
        hope to despair, from visions of life to visions of death. This torture
        by deception was part of the conveyor system at this slaughterhouse, it
        aided the SS men in their work. When the final act of robbing the living
        corpses was over, the attitude of the Germans to their victims underwent
        a sharp change. Rings were torn off unwilling fingers, and earrings
        wrenched out of ears.
      </p>

      <p>
        At this final stage, speed was important for the smooth working of the
        death conveyor. Hence the word &ldquo;Achtung&rdquo; was replaced by
        another word, a hissing, compelling word: &ldquo;Schneller! Schneller!
        Schneller! &rdquo; &ldquo;Faster! Faster! Faster into oblivion!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Experience has shown that when stripped a man loses his power of
        resistance and ceases to resist his fate; having lost his clothes, he
        seems to lose his instinct of self-preservation and accepts what happens
        to him as the inevitable. He who a moment before wished passionately to
        live becomes passive and apathetic. In order to make doubly sure,
        however, the SS employed at this last stage of their gruesome death
        conveyor a monstrous method of stunning their victims, of reducing them
        to a state of complete mental paralysis.
      </p>

      <p>How was this done?</p>

      <p>
        By switching over suddenly to senseless and inexplicable brutality.
        These naked men and women who had been stripped of everything but who
        continued stubbornly to remain human, a thousand times more human than
        the creatures in German uniforms surrounding them, still breathed, still
        saw, still thought, their hearts still beat. Suddenly, the soap and
        towels were knocked out of their hands. They were lined up five in a row
        and marched off to the accompaniment of rapped out commands:
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;H&auml;nde hoch! Marsch!&nbsp;Schneller! Schneller!
        Schneller!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        They were marched down a straight avenue about 120 metres long and two
        wide, and bordered by flowers and firs. This path led to the place of
        execution.
      </p>

      <p>
        Wire was stretched along either side of the path, which was lined by
        guards in black uniforms and SS men in grey standing shoulder to
        shoulder. The path was covered with white sand and as the victims
        marched forward with upraised arms they saw the fresh imprint of bare
        feet on the sand: the small footprints of women, the tiny footprints of
        children, the impress of heavy aged feet. These faint tracks on the sand
        were all that remained of the thousands of people who had recently
        passed down this path just as the present four thousand were passing now
        and as the next four thousand would pass two hours later and the
        thousands more waiting there on the railway track in the woods. Passed
        as they had the day before, ten days before, as they would pass tomorrow
        and fifty days hence, as they had passed throughout the thirteen months
        of the existence of the hell at Treblinka.
      </p>

      <p>
        The Germans called it &quot;the road from which there is no
        return.&quot;
      </p>

      <p>
        Smirking and grimacing, a fiend in human shape whose name was Suckhomil,
        ran alongside shouting in deliberately distorted German: &quot;Now then,
        lads, faster, faster! Your bath water is cooling. Schneller, Kinder,
        schneller!&quot;
      </p>

      <p>
        And bursting into loud guffaws the creature danced in a frenzy of
        delight. The victims moved on in silence with upraised arms between the
        two rows of guards, who beat them with rifle butts and rubber truncheons
        as they went by. Children ran to keep up with the grown-ups.
      </p>

      <p>
        The brutality of one of the fiends, an SS man called Zepf, especially
        impressed itself on all who witnessed this mournful procession. Zepf
        specialized in child-killing. Endowed with unusual physical strength,
        this creature would suddenly snatch up a child from the ranks and either
        dash out his brains by flinging him against the ground or tear him in
        two.
      </p>

      <p>
        When I heard about this creature who had evidently been born of a woman
        I could not believe the unimaginable and incredible things that were
        told of him. But when these stories were repeated to me by people who
        had seen with their own eyes, I believed and I realized that what they
        had seen was merely one of the details that fitted perfectly into the
        whole gruesome picture of Treblinka.
      </p>

      <p>
        Zepf&rsquo;s acts were part of the hideous farce staged by the
        tormentors to stun the mentality of their doomed victims; they were an
        expression of the senseless cruelty employed for the purpose of
        undermining will and consciousness. It was an essential screw in the
        huge machine of the fascist state.
      </p>

      <p>
        The horror of it is not that nature should beget such
        degenerates&mdash;for there is much that is freakish in the organic
        world&mdash;such as cyclopes, two-headed creatures, and creatures with
        corresponding mental deformities and abnormalities. What is dreadful is
        that these creatures, who ought to have been isolated and placed under
        observation as psychiatric phenomena, should be allowed to exist and
        function as citizens in some one state. Their insane mentality, their
        diseased minds, their phenomenal crimes are the necessary elements of
        the fascist state. Thousands, tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands
        of creatures like these form the backbone of German fascism, the
        mainstay and foundation of Hitler Germany. Dressed in uniforms, carrying
        weapons, and decorated with orders of the empire, these creatures lorded
        it for years over the lives of the European peoples. It is not the
        creatures themselves that should fill us with horror, but the state that
        caused them to crawl out of their holes, and made them useful,
        indispensable and irreplaceable in places like Treblinka, near Warsaw,
        at the Lublin Majdanek, in Be&#322;&#380;ec, in Sobib&oacute;r, in
        O&#347;wi&#281;cim, in Baby Yar, in Domanewka and Bogdanovka near
        Odessa, in Trostyanets near Minsk, at Ponary in Lithuania, in tens and
        hundreds of prisons, labour and punitive camps, camps for the extinction
        of life.
      </p>

      <p>
        The journey from the booth to the place of execution took only a few
        minutes. Hurried forward by blows, deafened by shouts, the victims
        reached the third open lot, and for a moment halted in astonishment.
      </p>

      <p>
        Before them stood a handsome stone building decorated with wooden
        fretwork and built in the style of an ancient temple. Five broad
        concrete steps led up to a low, massive and handsomely decorated door.
        Flowers grew at the entrance. For the rest, however, chaos reigned.
        There were mountains of fresh earth everywhere. A huge excavator clanked
        and rattled as it dug up tons of yellow sandy soil with its steel jaws,
        raising a cloud of dust that blotted out the sun. The roar of the
        machine digging huge graves from morning till night mingled with the
        savage barking of dozens of Alsatian dogs.
      </p>

      <p>
        On either side of the temple of death ran narrow-gauge lines over which
        men in loose overalls pushed small self-dumping waggonettes.
      </p>

      <p>
        The wide door of the slaughterhouse opened slowly and two of the
        assistants of Schmitt, the chief of the death factory, appeared at the
        entrance. These were sadists and maniacs. One, aged about thirty, was
        tall with massive shoulders, dark hair and a swarthy face beaming with
        excitement; the other, slightly younger, was short, brown-haired, with a
        pasty, jaundiced complexion. The names of these traitors to mankind are
        known.
      </p>

      <p>
        The tall one held a heavy piece of gas piping, about a metre long, and a
        whip. The second carried a sabre.
      </p>

      <p>
        At this moment the SS men released the dogs who in obedience to careful
        training threw themselves on the crowd and dug their teeth into the bare
        flesh of the doomed people. With savage cries the SS men brought their
        rifle butts down on the women, who stood rooted to the spot with terror.
      </p>

      <p>
        Inside the building Schmitt&rsquo;s men drove the victims into the gas
        chambers.
      </p>

      <p>
        At that moment Kurt Franz, one of the Treblinka commandants, would
        appear, leading his dog Bari on a leash. Bari had been trained by his
        master to tear out the victims&rsquo; sex organs. Kurt Franz had made
        quite a career for himself in the camp. Beginning as a junior
        non-commissioned SS officer, he had been promoted to the fairly high
        rank of an Untersturmf&uuml;hrer. This tall, skinny thirty-five-year-old
        SS man not only displayed organizing abilities, not only loved his work
        and imagined no occupation for which he was better suited than the
        supervision of Treblinka, but, in addition to all this, he was something
        of a theoretician and loved to generalize and explain the meaning and
        significance of his work. It would have been a good thing if during
        these terrible moments the Pope and Mr. Brailsford and all the other
        humane defenders of Hitlerism had come to the gas chambers in the
        capacity of spectators, of course. They would have been able to add new
        arguments to their humanitarian preachings, books and articles.
        Incidentally, the Holy Father, who so benignly kept silent while Himmler
        was committing his atrocities against mankind, would have been able to
        calculate the number of batches in which the Germans could have put his
        whole Vatican through Treblinka.
      </p>

      <p>
        Great is the power of humanity; humanity does not die until man dies.
        And when there comes a brief but terrifying period in history, a period
        in which the beast triumphs over man, to his last breath the man slain
        by the beast retains his strength of spirit, clarity of thought and
        warmth of feeling. And the beast who slays the man remains a beast. In
        this immortal spiritual strength of human beings is a solemn martyrdom,
        the triumph of the dying man over the living beast. Therein, during the
        darkest days of 1942, lay the dawn of reason&rsquo;s victory over
        bestial madness, of good over evil, light over darkness, of the power of
        progress over the power of reaction; an awesome dawn breaking over a
        field of blood and tears, an ocean of suffering, a dawn breaking amid
        the screams and cries of perishing mothers and infants, amid the death
        rattle of the aged.
      </p>

      <p>
        The beasts and the philosophy of the beasts foreshadowed the end of
        Europe, the end of the world; but people remained people. They did not
        accept the morals and laws of fascism, fighting with all the means at
        their disposal against them, fighting with their death as human beings.
      </p>

      <p>
        I was shaken to the very depth of my being by the stories of how the
        living corpses of Treblinka up to the last minute preserved their human
        souls although they had lost everything else, how women tried to save
        their sons and for their sake accomplished feats of hopeless bravery,
        how young mothers tried to shield their infants with their bodies. No
        one knows and no one will ever know the names of these mothers. There
        are stories of little girls of ten who with divine wisdom comforted
        their sobbing mothers, of a little boy who on entering the gas chamber
        shouted: &ldquo;The Russians will avenge us, mama, don&rsquo;t
        cry!&rdquo; No one knows and no one will ever know the names of these
        children. We were told about dozens of doomed people who fought one
        against a legion of SS men armed with automatic weapons and grenades,
        and died standing up, their breasts riddled with bullets. We were told
        about the young man who stabbed an SS officer, about the lad who had
        taken part in the mutiny in the Warsaw ghetto and who by some miracle
        had managed to hide a grenade from the Germans and flung it into a group
        of executioners at the last moment. We heard about the battle that
        lasted all of one night between a group of the condemned and detachments
        of guards and SS men. The shooting and grenade explosions went on all
        through the night and when the sun rose the next morning the whole
        square was covered with the bodies of the fighters. Beside them lay
        their weapons&mdash;palings wrenched out of the fence, a knife, a razor.
        Never on this earth now will the names of these fallen fighters be
        known. We heard about the tall girl who tore a rifle out of the hands of
        a guard on the &ldquo;road from which there is no return,&rdquo; and
        fought against dozens of SS men. Two beasts were killed in that fight,
        and a third lost his arm. Terrible were the tortures to which this brave
        girl was subjected before she was finally put to death. She, too, is
        nameless.
      </p>

      <p>
        Yet is that quite true? Hitlerism robbed these people of their homes and
        their lives. Hitlerism sought to wipe their names out of living memory.
        Yet every one of them, the mothers who shielded their children with
        their bodies, the children who dried their mothers&rsquo; tears, those
        who fought with knives and flung grenades, those who fell in the
        nocturnal massacre, and the naked girl who, like some ancient Greek
        goddess, fought alone against dozens&mdash;all of these people who are
        no longer among the living have preserved forever the most splendid name
        of all, the name which the pack of Hitlers and Himmlers could not
        trample underfoot, the name of Man. History will inscribe as their
        epitaph: &ldquo;They Died for Humanity.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Inhabitants of the village of Wulka, the settlement nearest Treblinka,
        say that sometimes the shrieks of the women who were being murdered were
        so terrible that the whole village would run for miles into the forest
        to get away from the piercing maddening cries that rent the air.
        Presently the screaming would subside only to break out again as
        terrible and soul-tearing as before.... And this was repeated three and
        four times a day.
      </p>

      <p>
        I asked one of the executioners who had been taken prisoner about the
        cries. He explained that the women usually screamed when the dogs were
        unleashed on them and the whole crowd of doomed people were driven into
        the death house. &ldquo;They saw their end coming. Besides it was very
        crowded inside; they were beaten unmercifully and the dogs tore at
        them.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        The sudden silence fell when the doors of the gas chamber closed. The
        screaming broke out again when a fresh group was brought. This occurred
        twice, three times, four and sometimes five times a day. For Treblinka
        was not an ordinary slaughterhouse, it was run on the conveyor system
        copied from modern large-scale industry.
      </p>

      <p>
        And like any industrial enterprise, Treblinka did not always work as
        efficiently as has been described above. It developed gradually as new
        equipment and new rationalization methods were introduced. In the
        beginning there were three small gas chambers. While these were under
        construction several trainloads of victims arrived and the killing was
        done with axes, hammers and truncheons instead of fire-arms. This was
        done to prevent the surrounding population from suspecting the nature of
        the work at Treblinka. The first three concrete chambers were 5&times;5
        metres in size, i.e., they had an area of 25 sq.m. each. The height was
        190 cm. Each chamber had two doors, one to admit the living, the other
        to serve as an exit for the gassed corpses. This second door was very
        wide&mdash;approximately two and a half metres. The three chambers were
        erected on one foundation.
      </p>

      <p>
        These three chambers did not have the capacity Berlin demanded. It was
        then that the construction of the building described above was begun.
        Treblinka officials took pride in the fact that their gas chambers
        surpassed those of all the other Gestapo death factories in Majdanek,
        Sobib&oacute;r and Be&#322;&#380;ec for capacity and production floor
        space.
      </p>

      <p>
        For five days 700 prisoners worked on the erection of the new death
        factory. When the work was at its height a foreman came from Germany
        with his crew and set about installing the equipment.
      </p>

      <p>
        The new gas chambers, of which there were ten in all, were built
        symmetrically on the two sides of a wide concrete-floored corridor. Like
        the old three, they each had two doors, one from the corridor for the
        live victims, and another in the opposite wall to provide an outlet for
        the corpses. The latter led to platforms running on both sides of the
        building. Narrow-gauge tracks led up to the platforms. The corpses were
        first dumped onto the platforms and then loaded into waggonettes to be
        carried to the huge burial pits the excavators dug day and night. The
        floor of the gas chambers was laid at an incline toward the platforms to
        make it easier and faster to drag out the corpses. This was a
        substantial improvement over the old chambers where the corpses had to
        be carried out on stretchers or dragged out with straps.
      </p>

      <p>
        Each new gas chamber was seven metres wide and eight long, 56 sq.m. in
        all. The area of all the new chambers totalled 560 sq.m. and the three
        old chambers, which continued to operate when there were smaller groups
        to be wiped out, brought the total lethal floor space of the Treblinka
        death factory up to 635 sq.m. From 400 to 600 were herded into each gas
        chamber at a time, which means that working at capacity the ten new
        chambers destroyed 4,000 to 6,000 lives at once.
      </p>

      <p>
        At average operations pace the lethal chambers of the Treblinka hell
        were filled at least two or three times a day (there were days when they
        were filled as many as six times). At the lowest estimate, two loadings
        a day of the new chambers alone meant the destruction of some 10,000
        persons daily or some 300,000 every month. Treblinka was in operation
        every day for thirteen months. If however, we allow ninety days for
        stoppage, repairs and hitches in the delivery of the victims, it still
        leaves ten months of continuous operation. If the average number of
        victims a month was 300,000, in ten months Treblinka destroyed three
        million lives. Again we have the same fearful figure: three million; the
        first time we arrived at it through a deliberately low estimate of the
        number of victims brought in by train.
      </p>

      <p>
        To snuff out life ten to twenty-five minutes were required. In the early
        period after the starting of the new chambers, when the executioners had
        not yet established the efficiency peak and were still experimenting,
        the victims were subjected to fearful torture lasting for two and three
        hours before life left their tormented bodies. During the very first
        days the intake and outlet installations worked badly and the victims
        writhed in agony for anything up to eight or ten hours.
      </p>

      <p>
        Various means were employed to effect this mass slaughter. One of them
        was by forcing into the chambers the exhaust fumes from the engine of a
        heavy tank that served as a motor at the Treblinka power station. These
        fumes contained two to three percent of carbon monoxide, which has the
        property when inhaled of combining with the hemoglobin of the blood to
        form a stable compound known as carboxyhemoglobin. Carboxyhemoglobin is
        far more stable than the compound of oxygen and hemoglobin formed in the
        course of the respiratory process. In some fifteen minutes the
        hemoglobin combines with carbon monoxide to form a stable compound and
        is no longer capable of serving as an oxygen carrier. The victim begins
        gasping for air, but no oxygen reaches the suffocating organism; the
        heart beats as if ready to burst, driving blood into the lungs, but the
        poisoned blood can no longer assimilate the oxygen in the air. Breathing
        becomes hoarse, all the symptoms of painful strangulation appear,
        consciousness dims, and the victim perishes just as if he had been
        strangled.
      </p>

      <p>
        The second method, and one that was the most widely used, was pumping
        air out of the chambers with suction pumps until the victims were dead.
        As in the case of the first method, death was caused by depriving the
        victims of oxygen.
      </p>

      <p>
        The third method, used less but nevertheless used, was murder with
        steam. This method, too, aimed at depriving the organism of oxygen, for
        the steam was used to expel the air from the chambers.
      </p>

      <p>
        Diverse poisons, too, were employed, but this was experimentation; the
        first two were the methods generally used for mass murder on industrial
        scale.
      </p>

      <p>
        Thus, the work of the Treblinka conveyor was so designed, as to enable
        the beasts to deprive man successively of all the rights and privileges
        he had enjoyed throughout the ages.
      </p>

      <p>
        First they robbed him of freedom, home and country, and took him to a
        nameless bit of wasteland set in the midst of forests. Then they took
        his personal effects, his letters, photographs of his near ones, and
        after that, on the other side of the fence, they took away his mother,
        his wife, his child. They stripped him naked, took away his documents
        and flung them carelessly aside; in doing so they deprived him of his
        name. They drove him into a narrow passage with a low brick ceiling and
        thus robbed him at once of the sky, the stars, the wind and the sun.
      </p>

      <p>
        Then came the last act in the human tragedy, when the man passed through
        the last gate of the Treblinka hell. The doors of the concrete chamber
        clanged to behind him. These doors were held fast by a combined lock
        consisting of a massive bolt, a chain and a hook. There was no breaking
        down of this door.
      </p>

      <p>
        Can we overcome our horror and try to imagine how the people in these
        chambers felt during the last minutes of their lives?... Packed together
        so tightly that bones cracked and crushed chests could not expand to
        breathe, they stood there, one mass of humanity, covered with the clammy
        sweat of imminent death. Someone, with the wisdom of age perhaps, may
        have conquered his own fear sufficiently to say to the others:
        &quot;Take heart, this is the end.&quot; Someone no doubt shouted a
        terrible curse.... Those curses must come true! We can picture some
        mother making a superhuman effort to obtain a whit more breathing space
        for her child in order that his last anguished gasps might be alleviated
        if only by one-millionth by this last evidence of maternal solicitude.
        We can hear some young girl, her tongue turning to lead, ask piteously:
        &quot;But why are they suffocating me, why?&quot;
      </p>

      <p>
        What visions passed before the glassy eyes of the victims as their heads
        spun and their breath was stifled in their bodies? Their childhood, the
        happy days of peace, the last painful journey. Someone may have
        remembered the leering face of the SS man on the station square and
        thought: &quot;So that is why he laughed!&quot; The brain swam,
        consciousness faded and the last moment of terrible agony came....
      </p>

      <p>No, it is impossible to imagine what took place in that chamber....</p>

      <p>
        The dead bodies stood pressed close together, growing colder and colder.
        The children, witnesses maintain, clung to life longer than the adults.
        Within twenty to twenty-five minutes Schmitt&rsquo;s assistants would
        peer through the peepholes. The time had come to open the doors to the
        platforms. Urged on by the SS men, prisoners in overalls set about
        emptying the chambers. Since the floor sloped toward the platforms, many
        of the corpses rolled out by themselves. People who worked here told me
        that the faces of the corpses were yellow and that about seventy percent
        bled slightly at the nose and the mouth. Physiologists can no doubt
        explain this.
      </p>

      <p>
        SS men inspected the bodies exchanging remarks as they did so. If a
        groan or a slight movement showed that life still lingered, revolver
        shots snuffed it out at once. Then came teams of men armed with dental
        pincers to extract all gold or platinum teeth from the mouths of the
        corpses. These teeth were sorted out according to value, packed in boxes
        and sent to Germany. There is no doubt that had it been convenient or
        advantageous for the SS to extract the teeth from living people, they
        would have done so with no compunction, but evidently it was simpler to
        extract the teeth from corpses.
      </p>

      <p>
        The bodies were loaded in waggonettes and hauled to huge common graves,
        where they were laid in rows packed close together. The pit would not be
        filled in yet.
      </p>

      <p>
        While the gas chambers were being emptied out, the Scharf&uuml;hrer
        working on &ldquo;transport&rdquo; received a brief order over the
        phone. Thereupon he blew his whistle and the locomotive engineer shunted
        the next twenty cars up to the platform with the dummy station of
        Ober-Majdan. Another three or four thousand people carrying suitcases,
        bundles and packages of food alighted and walked to the station square.
        Mothers carried infants in their arms; the older children pressed close
        to their mothers&rsquo; skirts, staring curiously about them. There was
        something frightening about the square tramped down by so many millions
        of human feet. Why did the railway line end just beyond the station in a
        stretch of sere grass and a six-metre barbed-wire fence?...
      </p>

      <p>
        The whole gruesome business was timed perfectly so that the new victims
        started up the &quot;road from which there is no return&quot; at the
        very moment when the last corpses were being hauled to the ditches from
        the gas chambers. And the ditches stood open, waiting....
      </p>

      <p>
        And the camp commandant seated in his office amid heaps of papers and
        charts would telephone to Treblinka station. Another sixty-car train
        under a strong SS escort armed with light machine-guns and automatic
        rifles pulled heavily out of a siding and crawled to the narrow-gauge
        track running between the two rows of pine trees.
      </p>

      <p>
        The huge excavators operated day and night, digging huge dark ditches
        hundreds of metres long and many metres deep. And the ditches stood
        open. They were waiting. They did not wait long.

        AT THE END&nbsp;of the winter of 1943 Himmler came to Treblinka escorted
        by a group of important Gestapo officials. Himmler and his party landed
        by plane near the camp and drove in two cars through the main entrance.
        Most of the visitors wore army uniforms. A few, evidently experts of
        some kind, wore civilian clothes, fur coats and hats.
      </p>

      <p>
        Himmler inspected the camp in person and one of the people who saw him
        told us that the minister of death walked over to one of the huge
        ditches and stared into it for a long time. Those who accompanied him
        stood at a respectful distance waiting while Heinrich Himmler
        contemplated the colossal grave already half-filled with corpses.
        Treblinka was the Himmler firm&rsquo;s biggest factory.
      </p>

      <p>
        The SS Reichsf&uuml;hrer left the camp the same day. Before his
        departure Himmler issued an order to the camp command that dumbfounded
        them all&mdash;Hauptsturmf&uuml;hrer Baron von Pfein; his assistant
        Korol, and Captain Franz. The order was to proceed immediately to burn
        all the buried corpses, every single one of them, and to carry the ashes
        and residue out of the camp and strew them over the fields and roads.
        Inasmuch as there were already millions of corpses in the ground this
        seemed an incredibly difficult task. Moreover, the freshly killed
        victims were not to be buried but burned at once.
      </p>

      <p>
        What was the reason for Himmler&rsquo;s visit of inspection and his
        peremptory personal order? There was only one reason&mdash;the Red
        Army&rsquo;s victory at Stalingrad. The power of the Russian blow on the
        Volga must have been smashing indeed if a few days after it was
        delivered Berlin began to think of responsibility and retribution, if
        Himmler flew to Treblinka in person and issued orders calculated to hide
        the traces of the crimes committed within sixty kilometres of Warsaw.
        Such was the repercussion of the mighty blow the Russians dealt the
        Germans on the Volga.
      </p>

      <p>
        At first there was considerable trouble with the cremation; the bodies
        would not burn. True, it was observed that the bodies of the women
        burned better. Large quantities of gasolene and oil were used up, but
        this was expensive and in any case the effect was insignificant. Things
        began to look serious, when there arrived from Germany a thickset SS man
        of about fifty, an expert in his line.
      </p>

      <p>
        One cannot but marvel at the experts begotten by the Hitler
        regime&mdash;there were expert baby killers, expert stranglers, expert
        gas chamber designers and experts who specialized in the scientifically
        organized destruction of large cities in the course of a single day. So,
        too, an expert specializing in exhuming and burning millions of human
        bodies was found.
      </p>

      <p>
        Under his direction they began to build furnaces. These were a special
        type of furnace, for neither the Lublin furnaces nor those of the
        largest crematorium in the world could ever have handled such a gigantic
        number of corpses in so short a time as was required at Treblinka.
      </p>

      <p>
        The excavator dug a pit 250-300 m. long, 20-25 m. wide and 6 m. deep.
        Three rows of evenly spaced reinforced concrete pillars 100-120 cm. high
        were installed across the length of the pit to support steel beams that
        were laid along them. Rails were then laid crosswise across these beams
        at intervals of five to seven centimetres. The result was the grating of
        a titanic firebox. A new narrow-gauge railway was laid from the burial
        pits to the furnace pit. Soon afterwards a second and then a third
        furnace of like dimensions were built. Each of these furnaces took 3,500
        to 4,000 corpses at a loading.
      </p>

      <p>
        Another huge excavator arrived, followed soon afterward by a third. Work
        went on day and night. People who took part in the work of cremating the
        corpses say that the ovens resembled volcanoes; the frightful heat
        seared the faces of the workers, the flames leapt up to a height of
        eight to ten metres, clouds of thick black smoke reached the sky and
        hung in a heavy motionless blanket in the air. Inhabitants of the
        neighbouring villages saw the flame at night from a distance of thirty
        and forty kilometres as it curled above the pine woods surrounding the
        camp. The stench of burning flesh poisoned the whole countryside. When
        the wind blew in the direction of the Polish camp three kilometres away,
        the people there were almost asphyxiated by the frightful odour. More
        than 800 prisoners (which is more than the number of workers in the
        blast-furnace or open-hearth departments of big iron and steel plants)
        were engaged in burning the corpses. This monster workshop operated day
        and night for eight months without let up, but it could not cope with
        the millions of buried bodies. True, new batches of victims continued to
        arrive all the time, which added to the load on the furnaces.
      </p>

      <p>
        Trainloads were brought in from Bulgaria. The SS and the guards were
        delighted, for these people, deceived both by the Germans and the
        Bulgarian fascist government, and totally unaware of the fate awaiting
        them, brought large quantities of valuables, good food and white bread
        with them. Later trains began to come in from Grodno and Bia&#322;ystok,
        then from the rebellious Warsaw ghetto; trainloads of insurgent Polish
        peasants, workers and soldiers arrived. From Bessarabia came a group of
        Gypsies, 200 men and 800 women and children. They came on foot with
        their caravans; they too had been deceived and that is why two guards
        were able to bring 1,000 people, the guards themselves having no idea
        they were leading them to their death. Witnesses say that the Gypsy
        women clapped their hands in delight at the sight of the handsome
        building of the death house and up to the last minute had no inkling of
        what awaited them, a fact which amused the Germans tremendously.
      </p>

      <p>
        The SS men subjected the group of rebels from the Warsaw ghetto to
        especially vicious torture. They picked out the women and children and
        took them not to the gas chambers but to the cremation ovens. They
        forced the mothers, half crazed with terror, to lead their children
        between the red-hot bars on which thousands of dead bodies writhed and
        squirmed from the heat, twisting and turning as though alive; where the
        bellies of dead women with child burst open from the heat and still-born
        infants burned up inside rent wombs. This spectacle was enough to rob
        the strongest man of his reason, but the Germans knew that its effect
        would be a thousand times more terrible on a mother who was frantically
        trying to shield the eyes of her children from the ghastly sight while
        they shrieked in terror: &quot;Mama, mama, what are they going to do to
        us? Will they burn us?&quot; There were no such scenes in Dante&rsquo;s
        inferno.
      </p>

      <p>
        After they had amused themselves sufficiently with this spectacle, the
        Germans actually did throw the children into the flames.
      </p>

      <p>
        It is painful even to read about all this. The reader must believe me
        when I say that it is even more painful to write about it. &quot;Why
        write then?&quot; someone might say. &quot;What is the use of recalling
        all this?&quot;
      </p>

      <p>
        It is the duty of a writer to tell the truth however gruelling, and the
        duty of the reader to learn the truth. To turn aside, or to close
        one&rsquo;s eyes to the truth is to insult the memory of the dead. The
        person who does not learn the whole truth will never understand what
        kind of enemy, what sort of monster, our great Red Army is waging battle
        against to the death.
      </p>

      <p>
        The &quot;infirmary&quot; was also rearranged. At first all the sick
        were carried out to a fenced-off clearing where they were met by a
        so-called doctor and murdered. The bodies of the aged and sick who had
        been murdered were then conveyed on stretchers to the common graves. Now
        a round pit was dug and a grating laid at the bottom for the burning of
        corpses. Around the pit low benches like seats in a sports stadium were
        placed so close to the edge that anyone sitting on them was literally
        suspended over the edge of the pit. The sick and feeble who were taken
        into the &quot;infirmary&quot; were led to these benches facing the
        bonfire built of human bodies. After enjoying the situation to the full,
        the Nazi barbarians then proceeded to shoot at the grey heads and bent
        backs of the old people, who fell, dead or wounded, into the blazing
        fire.
      </p>

      <p>
        We never had a very high opinion of the German brand of humour. It was
        always far too heavy for our taste. But who could ever have conceived of
        anything like the sense of humour, the amusements, the practical jokes
        of the SS men at Treblinka?
      </p>

      <p>
        The SS held football matches with teams made up of condemned men, forced
        the victims to play tag, organized a chorus of the doomed. Next to the
        German dormitories was a menagerie where wolves, foxes and other
        comparatively harmless beasts of the forests were kept in cages while
        the most ferocious wild beasts the world had ever produced walked the
        earth freely, sat on benches and listened to music. They actually wrote
        a Treblinka hymn for the doomed unfortunates which included the
        following lines:
      </p>

      <p>F&uuml;r uns gibt&rsquo;s heute nur Treblinka,</p>
      <p>Das unser Schicksal ist.*</p>

      <p>
        A few minutes before their death bleeding, tormented people were forced
        to sing idiotic German sentimental songs:
      </p>

      <p>... Ich brach das Bl&uuml;melein</p>
      <p>Und schenkte es dem sch&ouml;nsten</p>
      <p>Geliebten M&auml;gdelein.**</p>

      <p>
        The camp&rsquo;s chief commandant selected a few children from one batch
        of prisoners, killed their parents, dressed up the children in fine
        clothes, fed them with sweets, played with them, and a few days later,
        when he was bored with them, ordered them to be killed.
      </p>

      <p>
        One of the chief sources of entertainment were the night orgies of
        violence against young and beautiful women and girls who were selected
        from every group of victims. The next morning the rapers personally
        escorted their victims to the lethal chambers. This was how the SS, the
        bulwark of the Hitler regime, the pride of fascist Germany, amused
        themselves at Treblinka.
      </p>

      <p>
        It must be noted here that these creatures were by no means robots who
        mechanically carried out the wishes of others. All witnesses speak of a
        trait common to all of them, namely, a fondness for theoretical
        argument, a predilection for philosophizing. All of them had a weakness
        for delivering speeches to the doomed people, for boasting in front of
        their victims and explaining the &ldquo;lofty&rdquo; meaning and
        &ldquo;importance&rdquo; for the future of what was being done in
        Treblinka. They were profoundly and sincerely convinced that they were
        doing the correct and necessary thing. They explained in detail the
        superiority of their race over all other races; they delivered tirades
        about German blood, the German character and the German mission. Their
        beliefs were set down in books by Hitler and Rosenberg, in pamphlets and
        articles by Goebbels.
      </p>

      <p>
        After a day of &ldquo;work&rdquo; and amusements such as those described
        above, they slept the sleep of the just, undisturbed by dreams or
      </p>

      <p>---</p>

      <p>
        * There is only Treblinka for us today&mdash;that is our fate. &nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        ** I plucked a flower and gave it to the loveliest of beloved maidens.
      </p>

      <p>---</p>

      <p>
        nightmares. Their conscience never worried them for the simple reason
        that they had no conscience. They went in for physical exercises, took
        great care of their health, drank milk every morning, were extremely
        fussy about their personal comforts, planted flowers in front of their
        homes and built summer-houses. Several times a year they went home to
        Germany on leave since their particular &ldquo;profession&rdquo; was
        considered &ldquo;injurious&rdquo; and their superiors jealously guarded
        their health. At home they walked about proudly, and if they did not
        talk about their work it was not because they were ashamed of it, but
        simply because, being disciplined, they did not dare to violate the
        solemn pledge to silence they had taken. And when they went arm-in-arm
        with their wives to the cinema of an evening and laughed loudly,
        stamping with their hobnailed boots on the floor in delight, it was hard
        to tell them apart from the average German man in the street. Yet these
        were beasts in the most literal meaning of the word.
      </p>

      <p>
        The summer of 1943 was exceptionally hot in these regions. There was not
        a drop of rain, not a cloud, not a puff of wind for many weeks. The
        burning of bodies proceeded at top speed. For nearly six months the
        furnaces had been going day and night, but little more than half of the
        dead had been cremated.
      </p>

      <p>
        The fearful moral and physical suffering began to tell on the prisoners
        whose job it was to burn the corpses. Between fifteen and twenty of them
        committed suicide every day. Many deliberately courted death by
        violating disciplinary rules. &ldquo;To get a bullet was a
        luxury,&rdquo; a baker from Kosow who had escaped from the camp told me.
        It was said that to be doomed to live in Treblinka was a hundred times
        worse than to be doomed to death.
      </p>

      <p>
        Charred bones and ashes were carried outside the camp grounds. Peasants
        from the village of Wulka were mobilized by the Germans to load the
        ashes on carts and strew it along the road leading from the death camp
        to the Polish labour camp. Child prisoners threw shovelfuls of ashes
        onto the road from the carts. Sometimes they would find melted gold
        coins or gold dental crowns among the ashes. These juvenile prisoners
        were called the &ldquo;children from the black road,&rdquo; because the
        ashes made the road black as a mourning ribbon. Car wheels made a
        peculiar swishing sound as they rolled over this road. When I travelled
        this way I kept hearing that mournful swoosh, coming from beneath the
        wheels like a low, timid plaint.
      </p>

      <p>
        The peasants carted the charred bones and ashes from the spring of 1943
        until the summer of 1944. Every day twenty carts went out, each one
        making six or eight trips in the course of the day. In every load went
        100-125 kilograms of ashes and charred bones.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the &ldquo;Treblinka&rdquo; song the Germans forced the eight hundred
        corpse-burners to sing were words exhorting the prisoners to humbleness
        and obedience in reward for which they were promised &ldquo;a tiny bit
        of happiness which passes in a flash.&rdquo; Surprisingly enough there
        actually was one happy day in the Treblinka inferno. The Germans,
        however, were mistaken: neither obedience nor humility gave that day to
        the Treblinka doomed. It was the reckless courage of the brave that
        brought it into being.
      </p>

      <p>
        They had nothing to lose. They were all doomed, every day of their lives
        was hell. Not one of the witnesses of the frightful crimes would have
        been spared. The gas chamber awaited them one and all; in fact most of
        them were killed after working for a few days and replaced by new
        workers from the current groups of victims. Only a few dozen men lived
        weeks and months instead of days and hours. These were skilled workers,
        carpenters, stone-masons, or the bakers, tailors and barbers who served
        the Germans. It was they who formed a committee of revolt. Only
        condemned men, only men possessed by an all-consuming hatred and a
        fierce thirst for revenge could have conceived such a mad plan of
        revolt. They did not want to escape before destroying Treblinka. And
        they destroyed it.
      </p>

      <p>
        Weapons&mdash;axes, knives, truncheons&mdash;began to appear in the
        workers&rsquo; barracks. At what a price, at what a tremendous risk was
        each axe and knife procured! What incredible patience, cunning and skill
        was required to hide all this from the Argus eyes of the guards! The
        workers laid in stocks of gasolene to use for setting fire to the camp
        buildings. How did this gasolene accumulate and how did it disappear
        without trace as if it had evaporated into thin air? By superhuman
        effort, great mental strain, will power and fierce daring. A tunnel was
        then dug underneath the German arsenal building. Here again sheer daring
        worked miracles; the god of courage was on their side. Twenty hand
        grenades, a machine gun, rifles and pistols were carried out of the
        arsenal and secreted in hiding places known to the conspirators alone.
        The latter divided themselves into groups of five. The extraordinarily
        complex plan for the uprising was worked out to the minutest detail.
        Every group had its definite assignment. And, each of these
        mathematically perfect assignments was a piece of sheer madness in
        itself.
      </p>

      <p>
        One group was given the task of storming the watch towers, where the
        guards sat behind machine guns. Other groups were to attack the sentries
        on duty at the entrances to the camp grounds. Others were to tackle the
        armoured cars, to cut telephone communications, to attack the barracks,
        to cut passages through the barbed wire, to lay bridges across the
        anti-tank ditches, to pour gasolene on the camp buildings, to set fire
        to them and to destroy everything that lent itself easily to
        destruction.
      </p>

      <p>
        The plan even provided for the supply of money to the escaped prisoners.
        A Warsaw doctor who collected the money nearly gave the whole show away.
        One day a Scharf&uuml;hrer noticed a fat bundle of banknotes sticking
        out of his pocket&mdash;it was the current sum the doctor had intended
        to hide. The Scharf&uuml;hrer pretended not to have noticed it and
        reported the matter to Franz. Franz decided to question the doctor
        himself. He suspected something immediately. Why should a doomed man
        need money? Franz proceeded to cross-examine his victim with calm
        deliberation; he was convinced no person on earth could equal him in
        torturing a victim. But the Warsaw doctor outwitted the SS Hauptmann. He
        took poison. One of the participants in the uprising told me that never
        in Treblinka had such efforts been made to save a man&rsquo;s life.
        Evidently Franz realized that the dying doctor would carry his secret
        with him. But the German poison worked well and the secret remained
        unrevealed.
      </p>

      <p>
        Toward the end of July the heat became unbearable. Steam issued from the
        graves when they were opened as from gigantic boilers. The terrific
        stench and the heat of the furnaces killed men who toiled on the burning
        of the corpses. They dropped dead, falling headlong into the blazing
        furnace. Thousands of millions of fat-bellied flies crawled along the
        ground or filled the air with their monotonous drone. The last hundred
        thousand corpses were being burned.
      </p>

      <p>
        The uprising was scheduled for August 2. A revolver shot was its signal.
        Fortune favoured the sacred cause of the rebels. A new flame leapt
        skywards, not the thick heavy black smoke and flame of burning bodies,
        but the bright, hot and dancing flame of a conflagration. The camp
        buildings flared up and to the rebels it seemed that the sun had rent
        itself asunder and was burning over Treblinka, a symbol of the triumph
        of freedom and honour.
      </p>

      <p>
        Shots rang out and the machine guns on the towers captured by the rebels
        emitted a jubilant rat-tat-tat. The explosions of hand grenades sounded
        as triumphant as the clapping of the bell of Truth itself. The air shook
        from the detonations; buildings came crashing down, and the whistling of
        bullets deadened the odious buzzing of the carrion flies. Axes dripping
        blood flashed in the clear, pure air. On this day, August 2, the soil of
        the Treblinka hell was soaked with the evil blood of the SS men, and the
        radiant sky was tremulous with the triumph of this moment of vengeance.

        And here history repeated itself: As had happened in similar instances
        ever since the world began the creatures who had strutted as members of
        a higher race, who had thundered forth &ldquo;Achtung, M&uuml;tzen
        ab!&rdquo;, the creatures who had shouted for the people of Warsaw to
        come out of their houses to their death with the shattering compelling
        voices of master, &ldquo;Alle r-r-r-aus! Unter-r-r-r-r,&rdquo;; these
        creatures so confident of their power when it was a question of
        executing millions of women and children, showed themselves to be
        despicable cowards, miserable belly-crawling worms begging for mercy
        when it came to a real life-and-death struggle. They lost their heads,
        rushed hither and thither like frightened rats; they forgot all about
        the diabolically conceived system of defences Treblinka boasted. But is
        there really anything surprising about that, after all?
      </p>

      <p>
        Two and a half months later, October 14, 1943, there was an uprising in
        the Sobib&oacute;r death factory, organized by a Soviet war prisoner
        from Rostov, a political officer, Sashko Pechersky. And there the same
        thing was repeated as happened at Treblinka&mdash;half dead from
        starvation the people nevertheless proved able to cope with the hundreds
        of SS scoundrels bloated with the blood of their innocent victims.
        Wielding home-made axes forged in the camp smithies the rebels got the
        better of the executioners; many of them were &ldquo;armed&rdquo; with
        fine sand, with which Sashko had instructed them to fill their pockets
        beforehand for use in blinding the sentries. . . . But is there really
        anything surprising about that, after all?
      </p>

      <p>
        When Treblinka was enveloped in flames, and the rebels, bidding a silent
        farewell to the ashes of their fellow prisoners, left the barbed-wire
        compound, SS and police units were sent in pursuit. Hundreds of police
        dogs were set on their trail. The Germans brought out aircraft to hunt
        down the escaped prisoners. Battles were fought in the forests and
        marshes and few of the rebels lived to tell the tale.
      </p>

      <p>
        Treblinka ceased to exist on August 2. The Germans completed the burning
        of the remaining corpses, dismantled the brick buildings, removed the
        barbed wire, set fire to the wooden barracks that had survived the
        mutiny. The equipment of the death factory was blown up or dismantled
        and shipped away; the furnaces were destroyed, the excavators taken away
        and the huge innumerable ditches filled in with earth. The station
        building was razed to the last brick; the railway track and even the
        ties were removed. Lupine was planted on the site of the camp and a
        settler named Straben built himself a house there. The house is no
        longer there, for it has been burnt down since.
      </p>

      <p>
        What was the object of all this destruction? Was it to hide the traces
        of the murder of millions of people in the hell of Treblinka? But how
        did they expect to do this? Did they really think it possible to force
        the thousands who had witnessed the death trains moving from all corners
        of Europe to the death conveyor to keep silent? Did they believe they
        could hide that deadly flame and the smoke which hung for eight months
        in the sky, visible by day and by night to the inhabitants of dozens of
        villages and small towns? Did they think they could make the peasants of
        the Wulka village forget the fearful shrieks of the women and children
        which lasted for thirteen long months and which seem to ring in their
        ears to this very day? Did they imagine they could compel the peasants
        who had strewn the roads with human ashes for a whole year to keep
        silent? Did they imagine that they could compel to silence the survivors
        who had seen the Treblinka slaughterhouse in operation from its
        inception until August 2, 1943, the last day of its existence; the
        witnesses who have given accurate and corroborated accounts of every SS
        man and guard; witnesses who, step by step, have helped to reproduce a
        faithful picture of life in Treblinka from day to day? These can no
        longer be ordered: &ldquo;M&uuml;tzen ab!&rdquo;, these can no longer be
        led off to the lethal chamber. And Himmler no longer has power over
        these henchmen of his who with bowed heads and fingers that tug
        nervously at the edges of their jackets recount in dull toneless voices
        the delirium-like story of their crimes.
      </p>

      <p>
        A Soviet officer wearing the green ribbon of the Stalingrad Medal takes
        down page after page of the assassins&rsquo; depositions. At the door
        stands a sentry, his lips pressed tight. The same Stalingrad Medal hangs
        on his chest. His gaunt, weather-beaten face is grim. It is the face of
        popular justice. How symbolical&nbsp;it is, actually, that one of the
        victorious Stalingrad armies has come here to Treblinka, near Warsaw! It
        was not for nothing that Heinrich Himmler rushed to Treblinka by plane
        in February 1943, not for nothing that he ordered furnaces to be built
        and the traces to be burned and wiped out. No, it was to no purpose that
        he hurried so! The Stalingrad fighters came to Treblinka; the road from
        the Volga to the Vistula proved short. Now the very soil of Treblinka
        refuses to be an accomplice in the crime, in the atrocities that have
        been committed, and it spews forth the bones and the belongings of the
        murdered victims, whom the Hitlerites so vainly tried to hide in its
        depths.
      </p>

      <p>
        We arrived at the Treblinka camp early in September, thirteen months
        after the day of the uprising. For thirteen months the slaughterhouse
        had been in operation. For thirteen months the Germans had endeavoured
        to hide the traces of its work.
      </p>

      <p>
        It was quiet. The tops of the pines flanking the railway track barely
        stirred. Millions of human eyes had stared out of the carriage windows
        at these pines, this sand, this old tree stump, as the train pulled
        slowly into the platform. The ashes and crushed slag on the black road
        lined in neat German fashion with whitewashed stones swished softly.
      </p>

      <p>
        We enter the camp. We are treading the soil of Treblinka. The lupine
        pods burst open at the slightest touch, burst open by themselves with a
        faint popping sound; millions of tiny peas roll on the ground. The
        rattle of the falling peas, the popping sound of the bursting pods merge
        into a soft, mournful melody like a funeral dirge&mdash;faint,
        sorrowful, gentle&mdash;issuing from the bowels of the earth. The soil,
        rich and juicy as though linseed oil had been poured on it, the
        fathomless earth of Treblinka, as oozy as the sea bottom, gives under
        your feet. This plot of land fenced off with barbed wire has consumed
        more human lives than all the oceans and seas in the world ever since
        the birth of mankind.
      </p>

      <p>
        The earth ejects crushed bones, teeth, bits of paper and clothing; it
        refuses to keep its awful secret. These things emerge from the unhealed
        wounds in the earth. There they are&mdash;the half-rotted shirts of the
        slain, the trousers, shoes, tarnished cigarette-cases, the tiny
        cogwheels of watches, penknives, shaving brushes, candlesticks,
        children&rsquo;s shoes with red pompons, towels with Ukrainian
        embroidery, lace underwear, scissors, thimbles, corsets, trusses. Out of
        another fissure in the earth crawl heaps of utensils: cups, pots,
        basins, tins, pans, aluminium mugs, bowls, children&rsquo;s bakelite
        cups.... And beyond, out of the bottomless, swollen earth, as though
        pushed forward into the light of day by some invisible hand, emerge
        half-rotted Soviet passports, notebooks with Bulgarian writing,
        photographs of children from Warsaw and Vienna, letters written in
        childish scrawl, a volume of poetry, a prayer copied on a yellowed
        fragment of paper, food ration coupons from Germany.... Hundreds of
        perfume bottles of all shapes and sizes, green, pink, blue.... Pervading
        everything is the nauseating stench of corruption, a stench that neither
        fire nor sunshine, rain, snow or wind have been able to overcome. And
        hundreds of tiny forest flies swarm over the decaying fragments of
        clothing and paper.
      </p>

      <p>
        We walk over the bottomless Treblinka earth and suddenly something
        causes us to halt in our tracks. It is the sight of a lock of hair
        gleaming like burnished copper, the soft lovely hair of a young girl
        trampled into the ground, and next to it a lock of light blonde hair,
        and farther on a thick dark braid gleaming against the light sand; and
        beyond that more and more. These are evidently the contents of one, but
        only one, of the sacks of hair the Germans had neglected to ship off.
      </p>

      <p>
        Then it is all true! The last wild hope that it might be a ghastly
        nightmare has gone. The lupine pods pop open, the tiny peas beat a faint
        tattoo as though a myriad of tiny bells were really ringing a funeral
        dirge deep down under the ground. And it seems the heart must surely
        burst under the weight of sorrow, grief and pain that is beyond human
        endurance.

        Scientists, sociologists, criminologists, psychiatrists and philosophers
        are puzzling over this phenomenon. What is it&mdash;innate or
        hereditary, is it the result of upbringing, environment, external
        influences, is it predetermined by history or is it the criminal will of
        the leaders? What is it, how did it come to pass? The embryonic traits
        of the race theory which sounded so comical when expounded by
        second-rate pseudo-professors or the puny provincial theoreticians of
        last-century Germany, the contempt of the German philistine for the
        Russian, the Pole, the Jew, the French, the British, the Greek and the
        Czech, the whole of this cheap and tawdry German superiority over the
        rest of mankind that was good-naturedly laughed off by journalists and
        humorists, was suddenly in the course of a few years transformed from
        mere childish babble into a deadly menace to mankind, a menace to life
        and freedom and became the source of incredible and unparalleled
        suffering, bloodshed and crime. There is definite food for thought here.
      </p>

        Wars like the present are terrible indeed. Rivers of innocent blood have
        been spilt by the Germans. But today it is not enough to speak of the
        responsibility of Germany for what has happened. Today we must speak of
        the responsibility of all nations and of every citizen in the world for
        the future.
      </p>

      <p>
        Every man and woman today is in duty bound to his conscience, to his son
        and his mother, to his country and to mankind to examine his heart and
        conscience and reply to the question: what is it that gave rise to
        racism, what can be done in order that Nazism, Hitlerism may never rise
        again, either on this or the other side of the ocean, never unto
        eternity.
      </p>

      <p>
        The imperialist idea of national, race, or any other exceptionalism led
        the Hitlerites logically to Majdanek, Sobib&oacute;r, Be&#322;zec,
        O&#347;wi&#281;cim and Treblinka.
      </p>

      <p>
        We must remember that racism, fascism will emerge from this war not only
        with bitter recollections of defeat but also with sweet memories of the
        ease with which it is possible to slaughter millions of defenceless
        people.
      </p>

      <p>
        This must be solemnly borne in mind by all who value honour, liberty and
        the life of all nations, of all mankind.
